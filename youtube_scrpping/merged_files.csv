Just an advertisement for this cancer clinic.,I once had cancer virus 🦠 for over 10 years and I visited so many States in the United States 🇺🇸 seeking for help but it was all leading to spending of thousands of dollars until I was watching a YouTube series and I came across Dr. Emovon on YouTube ads and I decided to order his herbal medication and today I'm fully well from this problems. #dremovon..🙏🙏,have u guys some news,I have a biopsy Thursday and it’s really scary. Thank you for sharing your story ❤,Sadge,But in reality they are useless. Speaking from experience with 3 family members who had and fought cancer I can say that Macmillan did NOT give them any support. I would never give them a penny.,Lord God and angels is with you,Get your PSA tests done. Don't wait.,Dr Ozuka on YouTube has a permanent cure with his herbal medicine,Is this woman still alive?  This was made 9 years ago and pancreatic cancer is not as curable as she claimed.  It's one of the most difficult cancers to treat.,😢😢😢 hope u recover soon

Would x-rays pick up any cancer in the knee?  I have had knee pain just below the knee cap and went to see a top knee specialist in Denver but they didn't see anything on the x-rays but they said if it keeps bothering me to come back.  It sounds like they would do a knee scope.  Not sure they would do an MRI.  So does all the cancer show up on regular x-rays?  I do have a little arthritis but it is not too bad.,,,,,,,,,,

The higher the stage of the cancer the lesser the survivability rate and i would suggest that if you are diagnosed with bone cancer, please follow what your doctor says, it's not something that can be taken for granted.",,,,,,,,,,

I have tried almost everything but I couldn’t find any solution for the virus, despite all these happening to me, I always spend a lot of money to buy HIV drugs and other supplements to keep me healthy and taking several medications. Until one day I was just surfing through YouTube  when I came across a great post from Anita, who said that she was diagnosed with HIV and was healed through the help of this great herbal supplements of Dr Harvey, Sometimes I really wonder why people call him the  great Dr.Harvey, I never knew it was all because of the great and perfect work that he has been doing. So I quickly contacted him and told him everything happening to me, and he asked me a few questions and he said something I will never forget, that anyone who contacts him is always getting his/her cure within a few weeks after doing all he asks them to do. So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I'm HIV Negative wow. I'm very amazed and Happy about this cure i have really gone through so much pain and tears for this Dr.Harvey cured me with the help of his natural herbs.If you have anybody Going through this same situation or any kind of cancers or Diseases at all contact Dr Harvey today he cures them all save a life today.

,"It was may 2018 when I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at a local community hospital. My surgeon performed a lumpectomy on my left breast and also removed about 6 11 lymph nodes. One year later I was diagnosed at another community hospital with a metastasis of the breast cancer to my brain and was given about 6 months to live. The doctors said there was nothing could be possibly done about my condition and this left me in a very emotional state.
I read about how Dr Harvey cured someone's breast cancer using Dr Harvey Herbal Propolis Lecithin Capsules and I was desperate and decided to give it a try. I bought the Propolis Lecithin Capsules and consumed them exactly how Dr Harvey instructed me to and after a month and few days of completing the medication I became totally cured. I am more than thankful to Dr Harvey for giving me a second chance to life. You can get to Dr Harvey via (drharveyphytotherapy@yahoo.com) Whatsapp: +1 (971) 666-3103",,,,,,,,,

,"My name is Diane and I am a 6 year breast cancer survivor. My story began November 2014 when I felt a slight burning sensation in my right breast. I was working as a daycare provider and neglected to do anything, hoping the burning sensation was temporary.
On New Years Eve, 2011, the pain was so severe that I scheduled a mammogram the first week of 2015. A few days after I received a letter telling me to return for a second test.
A few more days passed and I received a letter telling me that there were suspicious findings on my film that needed further testing. My previous mammogram had been in October 2011. What could possibly be wrong?
I had nowhere to turn. I did not know what to do because the place that did the mammogram only told me to ask my primary care doctor. At that time I did not have a primary doctor.
I called my older sister and she told me to go to a gynecologist. I explained the situation to the gynecologist and immediately she found a doctor to give me a biopsy which i did and it was all to no avail until i met a old time high school mate friend Dana who is a survivor who introduced me to a pythothrapist DR HARVEY to God alone i give all the glory and i'm forever greatful to DR HARVEY for being a hand of God in my life....He cured me with his natural herbs and roots today i'm a living testimony.

,"I had prostate cancer couple of years ago. Though my local doctor in Delaware thought I should have surgery, but I  wanted to research other options first. I learned about the effectiveness of herbs using natural roots and herbs to cure cancer, which was available at Dr Ayes natural herbs and roots  world,a place of Cancer Center. There, I underwent seven weeks of daily natural therapy by administering the herbal remedy and met other men who were going through the same treatment. It’s incredible the way we were able to bond over our illnesses; we still keep in touch, check in on each other, compare notes, and get updates,but at the end of it all we were cured and healed permanently by Dr Ayes, After conducting series of test So I said. Dr Ayes herbal world was the best choice for me. My local hospital does not offer the type of treatment that I received, making me even more certain that I did the right thing by contacting Dr Ayes, So most times is better we forget about chemo or radiation  therapy and going natural with herbal medicine.with that we get free from cancer forever.All thanks to Him.  Urge every cancer patient to contact Dr, Ayes natural herbs and roots world.

,"Our bodies are starved of the right nutrition which will heal our cells, help grow healthy ones, build up our immune system and starve cancer cells!! I have been able to shrink my tumors and they are shrinking more every day (by leaps and bounds).  At this rate they should hopefully completely disappear within the next couple of months. I was diagnosed with a stage 4 Her2 positive breast cancer (fairly fast moving) and Chemo is not the answer for most cancers, there is a much better way -- most people do not survive it long term and hundreds are curing themselves naturally. Check out ""Chris beat cancer"" and how he did it....I am also curing myself of a stage IV that had mestastasized to my lymph nodes and hip joint by flooding my body with nutrition/wonderful supplements and juices!!!",,,,,,,,,

,"I discovered I had breast cancer by accident. I had just given birth to my 2nd child when I noticed a small lump on my breast. Milk was coming out, but I didn't think anything of it because I was breast feeding. Well while carrying the baby I noticed a lump and some pain. I immediately went to the radiologist where she told me straight out that she believed I should see a doctor ASAP because I might have breast cancer. I was so glad she told me so directly; otherwise I probably would have overlooked the milky discharge from my nipple as milk. I went through Chemotherapy, Double Mastectomy, and reconstruction still after some few years the symptoms still persists.
It was a long journey, and at times I wanted to give up, but I kept the fight for my two kids that I have to raise and kept searching for help until a friend of mine who was a survivor of Stage 4 Breast cancer introduced me to Dr Harvey who cured her using his natural herbal remedy.
I contacted him by email, he got back to me and told me about the solution to my illness and how to go about it, i did as he instructed and about the three days i got the cure Which he prepared and sent to me through DHL courier service, i administered the herbal medicine as he instructed me and that's how i was cured of Breast Cancer. All thanks to the superb healing herbs of Dr Harvey

,"Finding out I was HIV positive wasn't easy But as time has passed, I have slowly come to terms with my HIV-positive status and try to tackle it with a positive attitude. In mid-2015  I became quite ill. I developed persistent flu-like symptoms, headaches, a nagging cough and sores that wouldn't heal. My skin felt as if it was crawling, my legs ached, I felt nauseous and lost weight. Then exhaustion hit. It was an indescribable tiredness and no matter how much I slept I never felt rested. In 2016  I was hospitalized when my CD4 count nosedived to 86 (HIV-negative people have a CD4 count of between 700 and 1,000; a CD4 count of below 200 is considered dangerously low). It was a terrible time. I have a vivid memory of sitting in a wheelchair covered with a blanket and catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked and felt like a little old lady.
I was so ill I could barely walk 200 meters. I hadn't realized how little I appreciated my health until it was taken away from me. Fortunately I had a fantastic support system. Even though I was struggling to cope at work I didn't lose my job. On the contrary the company I work for, my colleagues and my boss have been incredibly supportive throughout my illness.
It was a frustrating time because I so desperately wanted to function like a normal human being. Yet I honestly thought I was going to die. I thought I was too far gone. It’s almost as if your body begins to reject everything it requires to sustain life. It was probably the scariest time of my life. I wished not for a bigger house or more money or a fancy car – I wanted to have the strength to go for a simple walk on the beach.
To this day that time has stuck with me and it has been life-changing. I wasn't really materialistic before but if I ever find myself becoming caught up in the whirlwind of life I stop and take myself back to that time. The best things in life really are priceless. All my pains and sorrows turn to joy and history from the day i came in contact with Dr HARVEY,,Who really helped me with his herbal prescriptions,I WAS TOLD HE IS A HERBALS  SPECIALIST AND HE CAN BE OF HELP, I gave him a try and it really work out for me, today here i am negative.

,"I was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and breast cancer  disease in which I  have tried all I could with medical prescription all to no avail.february 1999 and had my left kidney removed at that time.  It was determined that no other treatment was needed.  This was an incidental finding, seen on an ultrasound to check my gall bladder - I had no signs or symptoms from this tumor.  I was followed for 6 years and was deemed cured.

In April 2014, 15 years later, I noticed a lump at the top of my sternum and it turned out to be renal cell carcinoma from the tumor previously removed.  I am now Stage 4 as this is a metastasis. The cancer had grown through and broke the bone - I never had any pain or symptoms.  I had 10 radiation treatments and was put on oral in August 2014.  I started experiencing bone pain in Feb/March 2016 and was given an additional 10 radiation treatments which eliminated the pain.  A break in the bone just below the tumor was later identified when the scar tissue developed. I remain on daily oral chemotherapy, I was recently introduced to a Chinese herbalists Dr sale bashiru I contacted him and after necessary questions and forms fill out sent me herbs and oil   that cured me of all this diseases within three months of trial.im now symptoms and pain free.here is my email address if you may need help. sarahsmi100@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,

There was really no notable symptoms at the beginning not until she began to cough which got worse everyday and soon enough she was finding it more difficult to talk or breath properly. We tried several treatment for a better condition but all proved abortive, all the doctor's said cancer couldn't be cured but will have to go through a chemo or surgery but this was very risky for us, we searched other solution until we heard about a particular traditional doctor called Dr Balabash who cures Cancer with natural herbal remedies completely. We contacted doctor with his email drbalabashherbalhome@gmail.com and we were given instructions on how to get the herbs which we got after few days through the courier delivery company. She was told to take the remedy for one month but just within a few weeks of using it she experienced a total balance in her health, all the symptoms like coughing, breathing and sleeping problems and other emotional troubles was all gone. We went for a checkup after an appointment the sixth week and our doctor was surprised and said the tumor in her lungs is no longer there and she's completely free from Cancer.

,"My story with breast cancer is a unique one, My determination and working in accordance with my heart was key. I was diagnosed in September 2017 with stage 4 breast cancer with mets to the femur bone. I cried silently Day and Night because I wondered who will be there for my kids when I'm gone, I lost my husband 3 years ago and this also affected me a whole lot.
 Chemo was never an option as I had seen already what it did to my friend days before she gave up. Alternative and holistic medicine was my option. I had heard about the success stories of patient with cancer that got cured through alternative medicine from clinics and medicine in Mexico. I was able to get hold of a survivor and he told me about an herbalist he went to in Hidalgo, Mexico. We contacted via mail, over the phone and through skype. I showed him all my scans and blood work cause I wasn't having enough to fly over to Mexico. He prescribed and shipped some herbs for me that he called "" Apollo oil and Tea"" which I used for a period of 7 months. He also changed my diet and put me on his diet protocols for this period of time and prescribed some other supplements for me too. It was during this time my kids found out I had cancer because I had to change my diet.  
They were my wings through it all. Beating cancer is never an easy journey, friends and colleagues will never understand the pains and emotional battle you fight in this. It's been over a year now. MRI scan is clear no tumors and blood works came back normal. I have been "" NED"". Mu oncologist was stunned as he put an expiring date on my life and worst I refused Chemo. I am not saying conventional treatment is not good, cause I have also seen some success stories with it too. But my advice to whoever is reading this, follow your heart because that's the only way your spirit will work in accordance with whatsoever you choose. This is the contact information of the herbalist: drehimenherbal@gmail.com

Even every 2 years. So much cancer could be caught instead of just hand waving and saying ""your too young for x"" or something like that.",,,,,,,,

wish her well",,,,,,,,

Terrible thing to go through, incredibly scary and chemo can mess you up too..",,,,,,,,
,,"My first time I got cancer my parents said I was really weak and sick, second was kinda an accidental find with no real symptoms other than a bump, and third I suddenly had to up my dose of levothyroxine and I was really fatigued beforehand. Cancer can be sneaky for sure. Stay strong!",,,,,,,,
,,"Wow, for her situation, she is surprisingly positive. I would not be able to to handle something this terrible so calmly.",,,,,,,,

,,It's true. Make sure you get your tests done yearly. There's no shortage of stuff you can get tested. But also make sure you check that the test results are actually accurate before you take action! Not all tests are accurate,,,,,,,,
,,Only reason I’m worried for her is because she is playing valor at 😂 wishing her the best fr tho,,,,,,,,
,,"I’m not going to speak for Kyedae (because she’s a stranger on the internet) but some of these comments are weird asf. How does telling a story about someone you knew who died of cancer help anyone? What’s she supposed to do with that? Go? “Cool, I didn’t ask but I hope that’s not me?” It’s the weirdest phenomenon that happens whenever someone is diagnosed. It’s really awkward and not helpful lmao. Same with googling and commenting the statistics etc. (which btw show a pool from adults where the median age is 68 and some refrain from treatment). Shes young, healthy, has access to good care, plus she seems to have a support system and a pretty good attitude. She’ll do great:)",,,,,,,,

,,"The fact I read comments of people saying it was immature of her to hide it makes me lose hope in humanity. 
It was literally the opposite. You wouldn't have the strength to do the same if something like this happened to you.

,,Yep... Everything that Kyedae said is true...,,,,,,,,
,,"Cooking denatures protein, enzymes, and vitamins, and oxidizes fats, making it harder to digest. Grass fed ruminant animals are the most nutritious, partly because they can convert unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids, which is more stable for your cell membranes, and they supply protein to build muscle. Fruit is a good source of carbs, because it wants to be eaten so its seeds are spread around. Honey is good because it’s created by bees, which are an animal. Vegetables have defense chemicals because they don’t want to be eaten. You want to give your body as much energy and resources as possible, which means eating protein, saturated fat, and carbs, until you are full. This will ensure everything will work better as you heal. 

Eat raw grass fed ruminant animals/milk/butter/suet, and try raw fruit/fruit juice/honey. Experiment. Eat until full. Listen to your body. Your body will self regulate. 

You’re probably going to need to try multiple different sources to see what you like the best. Buy the best quality food you can afford. Start slow, and gradually change what you eat. I started cooking my meat a little bit more rare each time, until I just went for it. I freeze my meat, and then thaw it for a couple hours either in the fridge or on the counter. As long as the ruminant ate grass and was healthy, you shouldn’t have a problem. If eating fruit or honey or raw doesn’t make you feel good, don’t force it. It took a couple years for me to heal enough to eat fruit and honey. I eat 3 meals a day.",,,,,,,,

We encouraged her to get it checked out while we were in Mexico (she is spanish speaking) and they immediately knew it was cancer. She had surgery last week and I am struggling to figure out how to help her when she comes back to the states. Especially with speech therapy and continued check ups. I am a UH pharmacy student and was interested in doing the summer research with MD Anderson, now I have my mom to encourage me to do so for her and many others who are undergoing similar circumstances.",,,,,,,

The lesson here is that people shouldnt ever mock what another person is going through, however stupid or unreasonable it may seem to you. You wouldnt react any better if it happened to you as well. It means the world if you just comfort those people instead of getting all insensitive and logical per say.

But yes, I forgive my bf, he can be dumdum as well.",,,,,,

When my father was diagnosed with neck cancer earlier this year he was given a green folder with a telephone number in it and sent on his way. We haven't heard from his nurse from that day to this because once she found out he had a son it was like ""Oh well you may want to talk to him (me) about bringing you to appointments instead of sending an ambulance out for you."" Fuck off Macmillan why should I have to run around reorganising and juggling my life whilst dealing with the possibility of losing my father just to save the NHS a few quid? I wouldn't give or advise anyone to donate money to Macmillan Cancer Support if it was the last charity on earth because this advert is far from my experience and in my case they actually let me hit the floor.",,,,,
,,,,,Still the most powerfull cancer advert ive seen! The look on there faces when it hits home and the music together chokes me up!,,,,,
,,,,,I have A friend what has macmillian at the end of his name called bryan macmillian,,,,,

Then half way through my treatment I had a phone call, it was macmillans wanting to ask me some questions, ok I said ask me - "" what cancer have you got "" , second question "" does your wife work full time ""  when I said YES the woman on the phone quickly said "" thank you, we will be in touch "". That was over two years ago, never heard from them and never got any support from them, my wife hade to do everything on her own.    This is a charity what takes but does not give.﻿",,,,,

,,,,,How are things with you now? ,,,,,

They look like they have been burned.  I lived 6 months on popcorn.  Today I am 230 pounds eating Mexican food.  Cancer is not the demon it used to be.  Much prayer + a caring wife + a good oncologist = healing.  You have got to have a spirit to fight and loved ones to live for.,,,,
,,,,,,How is Delia doing now?,,,,
,,,,,,GET WELL SOON 😁,,,,
,,,,,,GET WELL SOON,,,,
,,,,,,"Please ead. Will ne fine.
My father was a strong man and after he had surgery for colon-rectal cancer, he died after a lot of suffering in about three months. 
The doctor thought I had the same cancer and wanted to operate on me. As I had already studied a lot about cancer, I refused the operation. The doctor told me that I will be back in six months. But 14 years of a very active life have passed. 
If you want to beat the cancer:
1. Chemotherapy means that you destroy not only your cancer cells, but also many healthy cells, which you need. A very bad thing is that it  may destroy your immune system, the one that tells the body when you have cancer and that knows how to fight cancer. 
2. Radiotherapy is well known to cause cancer. The underlying idea is that cancer cells will die. it's true, it destroys them. But it can also turn healthy cells into new cancer cells. There is some hope if you follow radiation therapy with doses of radiation very precise targeted at the cancer. 
3. Surgery is a solution, but it often spreads the cancer to other parts and thus creates new cancers. 

What can you do: 
1. Prayer to God. Yes, God really exists. And He asks us to love Him, people and do good deeds. 
2. To search very persistently for our sins and mistakes. Don't look for excuses, they only have value if God considers that you deserve to be forgiven. Don’t hide yourself behind exchuses like “I didn’t anything to do” or “Others did too”. I searched for my sins and mistakes for several months. 
3. Stop eating meat and sweets. It is easier that you think!
4. Daily, up to half a liter of beetroot juice. 
5. Seeds of all kinds. 
6. Cancer is not a tragedy. Fight calmly. Moderate action. 
7. It would be very good if you have the strength to follow the treatment of Rudolf Breuss. Sure you can.
Help her, please God, to be healthy!",,,,

So we draw up saline from ampoules and it seems the plastic doesn’t leech into the saline as much, because I’ve asked heaps of my patients about it and only 1 said they had a strange taste from it and it was very subtle. So my theory is that the pre-drawn saline absorbs a little bit of stuff from the syringe plastic and gives that adult taste.",,,,

,,,,,,"If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.Romans 10. 9-10
so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.Hebrews 9. 28

Dear God in heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life that I have lived; I need your forgiveness. I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin. You said in Your Holy Word, Romans 10:9 that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we shall be saved. Right now I confess Jesus as the Lord of my soul. With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very moment I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word, right now I am saved. Thank you Jesus for your unlimited grace which has saved me from my sins. I thank you Jesus that your grace never leads to license, but rather it always leads to repentance. Therefore Lord Jesus transform my life so that I may bring glory and honor to you alone and not to myself. Thank you Jesus for dying for me and giving me eternal life. Amen",,,,

The bone cancer destroyed my hip so I have an artificial hip which works well. My advice to anyone with cancer is stay active and most importantly keep your weight up. I use Ensure Plus 350 calorie protein drinks in between meals and my weight went up fast but the Oncologist said I probably won't get to exactly my pre cancer because of my age.

It also allows it to be left in overnight (like for example I do infusions at home so we have a nurse come to me and there are times when I have surgery the next day and she is able to leave my port accessed whereas with an IV you can’t leave it accessed at home and stuff but you can with a port) and also something that I recommend (idk if you do this already or not but) is numbing cream. You put it on around 30-45 minutes before it’s accessed and it numbs it so you can’t feel the prick. Also I agree the alcohol stuff stinks right through the mask.",,,,
,,,,,,"Reverse Your Cancer Disease Today Via A Very Natural Herbal Process...


 I was only 40 when I was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. I was experiencing shortness of breath and it felt like something was in my throat. Whenever I raised my hands over my head, it would cut off my air supply. I went to my primary care doctor, who sent me for a CT scan.


 My family and I were shocked at the news of my diagnosis with terminal stage 4 lung cancer. My husband and I decided it was best to tell our daughters the truth from the start. They were young, just 5 and 9, and they were worried about me and asked many questions. Having a plan in place to help me beat cancer made it easier to have that conversation with them.


 Because the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes, I wasn’t a candidate for surgery. My best option was a clinical trial and I was scheduled to receive four rounds of intense chemotherapy with the trial drug. After those four heavy rounds, I was switched to a lighter maintenance chemotherapy drug and the trial drug for the remainder of my two-year course of treatment.


 During treatment, there was so much I worried about. I didn’t want to lose my hair, and I endured side effects including nausea and exhaustion.

 Although, after some time the side effects had worsened, there was the loss of hair and I had been very exhausted most of the time. I also experienced loss of appetite.


 It was during my endless research for a permanent remedy on the internet for my condition, I was opportune to come across the professional herbal works of Dr. Harry Obiego - the African man doctor who had completely reversed the disease via a naturopathic method. I had seen testimonials attributed to the service of this herbal doctor and his distinguished skills in the world of phytotherapy. I was informed that he was capable of healing cancer via a completely natural, herbal procedure, and of which I had been really tempted to give his service a trial. I had nothing to lose, all I had wanted was to be saved from this debilitating disease, and in spite of anything it would cost me. And Providence had thus, led this herbal practitioner into my life to give my health life a different interpretation - In brief, after having tried his natural medication I had soon started experiencing positive impact in my health life. It was too good to be true for after some time of usage, I knew I was on the verge of an absolute recovery. After some few weeks of using this natural medication, I had gone for another biopsy test which had confirmed I had been completely freed from the disease.


 This miraculous change in my health life had occurred few months ago and I am very much as pleased to share this piece of information every moment because it means so much to me as to be healthy again, and I know inwardly, that it would also mean so much to other people who happen to be suffering from this disease and would also prefer a normal life too. I wish to use this message to give confidence to those who would by chance happen to come across this information to be hopeful and find a confidant like Dr. Harry Obiego in overcoming their health problems. You can reach this herbal practitioner today for a healthier tomorrow. I would also encourage this piece of information to be shared among friends and loved ones in order to create a positive awareness.

""Not medical advice. Consult with your doctor.""
Do your own research.
What I would do if I had cancer:
1 pound of cannabis flower consumed over 4 - 5 months ($300 - 400 per month) has shown very promising results (run from the cure documentary) reversing advanced stage cancer.
Other treatments I would consider if I had cancer:
Vitamin D: - to strengthen and modulate immune function.
  - Safe sun exposure: 30 - 45 min of full body, mid-day sun exposure 5 days per week. During weeks with no sun exposure,, take 10000 iu vitamin D for no more than 3 weeks. Then 5000iu daily after. - get blood work every 6 months to be sure  Vit. D is 60 - 100 ng/dL.

- Low Protein diet: No animal products. No protein powders, or foods high in protein such as beans, lentils, peas.

- Avoid added sugar. - cancer feeds on sugar.

- gcMAF therapies: Bravo probiotic.

- vitamin C: 2000 mg every 2 hours.

- juicing vegetables daily.

- Sodium bicarbonate: orally (check correct dose) - to alkalize the body. Take away from food - 2 hours to not neutralize stomach acid needed for digestion. -
OR - 1.5 - 2 cups in a bath for 20-30 min 5 days per week.

Eat organic foods.

Bentonite clay body mask or bath - to absorb toxins: full body mask - 30 min., then shower.
OR bath - Add 2 cups to bath for 30 min. - 3 - 5 days per week.
Digestive detox: Activated charcoal: 8 - 10 caps daily - away from food and sodium bicarb.:  4 - 5 days per week.

You can treat cancer in 1 to 2 months by just eating cruciferous vegetables must be all organic. You can make juices out of them too. Also garlic(no green inside) lemon and lemon skin and onions are good. And water must be spring water. 
Also take graviola capsules 4 a day. And if you can get to something called pao pereira do that. Also start releasing fasting is a must! You need to fast so that your body eats the bad stuff inside. And after that start checking your food habits eliminate non organic foods/alcohol etc from ur life. These are not meant for our bodies to consume. Just like how ducks are not allowed to eat bread yet they do eat it but guess what happens to these ducks? They get sick and die. It's not for them. Same thing with us. We humans too have specific food we can eat and others we can't eat. 
Do your research trust in what people are saying not some doctor that benefits from your money. It's a buisness for them. Be careful! I promise you if you follow what I just wrote you will be cured100% in 1 to 2 months. Do more research on what I said and see for yourself. Think about it well. My friends around me all followed this diet. There are many doctors like a herbalist doctor for example that tells you this and even have great knowledge on what herb can 100% cure you depending on what type of problem u have. So Alternative cancer treatments. I wish you all the best really I hope we all realise that our nowadays lifestyles are unfortunately wrong and that unfortunately some certain ppl actually benefit from all that...",,,,

You are completely right about that saline solution you never forget the taste or smell.. Just like when they removed my port the smell of burning blood is horrible too.. I still look at it and how it left a scar on my chest to this day and it just reminded all I had to do to learn how to walk all over again..

,,,,,,"Hello, I just subscribed after watching this video. Wishing you all the best, and hope you fight through this and heal fully. 

My aunt who took care of me when I went though a lot of hard times unfortunately went through breast cancer but couldn’t make it because she chose to heal naturally (at home). Unfortunately the cancer spread to her lungs, then bones, and then right arm and right eye. Few days ago, the cancer spread to her heart and yesterday, she rested in peace while sleeping. Breast cancer is very scary but also hard to fight. It is definitely tough, and I know you feel the pain. But it’s ok… you are gonna be ok…. I will pray for your wellness, as well as your family who loves you the most. I am supporting you from Korea.

All the best xoxo",,,,

,,,,,,"Cancer cells are the result of the aging of our cells.  This means that cells age regardless of my age.  There are two causes of accelerated aging of cells.  First, DNA methylation, and second, telomere damage.  A lobster whose telomeres are not extremely damaged does not get cancer, lives an average of 500 years, and an elephant produces 60,000 milligrams (60 grams) of vitamin C per day in its body, and it has plenty of p53 genes, so it does not get cancer.

 Why does DNA methylation occur?
 1. Stress.
 2. Smoking and drinking alcohol
 3. Virus infection and vaccines (vaccination ... including Covid19 vaccines)
 4. Inflammation in the body due to bacterial infection
 5. Meat intake (saturated fat, bad cholesterol)
 6. Body fat (less muscles and sedentary lifestyle)
 7. Not enough vitamin D in the body.  Vitamin C deficiency
 8. Lack of sleep (less melatonin)
 9. Parental genetic issues (activity of the P53 gene)

 Telomere damage is also caused by drinking and smoking, heavy metals, pesticides, burned food, fine dust, pollutants, meat, etc.

 A substance that prevents DNA metallization.  - Tofu (isoflavin).  Resveratrol.  Folic acid.  Vitamin B12.  Curcumin.  Omega 3. Lipozomal vitamin C. Vitamin D. Quercetin.  EGCG

 To improve the p53 gene, take low-dose naltrexone (3.5 mg per day) and alpha-poinic acid.

 , albendazole (or penbendazole or mebendazole1200ㅡ2400 mg and olive oil 50 ml with 200ㅡ400mg cimetidine. 80mg artovastatin 4 days, quercetin2400mg resveratrol 1200mg egcg 400mg meformin 1000 ml omega 3 meriva curcumin1500mg daily.  take 15 -20grams liposomal vitamin C, 100 mg doxycycline, and 500 mg  azithromycin for 3 days when you do not take albendazole(mebendazole.penbendazole) cimetidine artovastatin after dinner .. Taking a hot  bath for 1 hour a day can cure cancer. you take  3.5mg naltrexon 5000iu vitamin d every day. low dose of naltrexon enhance yiur immunity 4times and your nk killer cells kill cancer cells. The doctor told me that my life ends in a month.but I did this method for 6 months. and i completed. i cured cancer..  The cure rate of cancer is around 3% with chemo theraphy and radioactive. If people get cancer again after 5 years, everyone dies with 99% possibility...  albendazole and pbz mbz kill cancer and cancer stem cells.  it happens never again. ..... in korea there are many people who cure cancer with this method.  very quickly and without side effects .....

 12-48mg ivermectin 50mg zinc cure covid 19 for7days (500mg quercetin.5g liposomal vitaminc)

 you can take up to 96mg ivermectin a day .. 20 days straightly.  cancer patients in korea took experiments.  he took 120mg a day for 20 days straightly to cure the terminal cancer ...

you can not cure cancer with chemo theraphy. it does not cure but makes powerful duplication slowly..but eventually die due to cancer.


in korea. 50 years old man who has the stage 4 lung cancer . he had taken tagrisso and radiation theraphy for 2 years but cancer cells has transfered to spine bones and it grows bigger and bigger so he can not walk and then he stopped taking tagrisso for a while. and then he take 3200mg albendazole( or penbendazole .mebendazole) a day with  50ml olive oil. phytocapinoids. 2400mg meriva curcumin .400mg egcg .1000mg metphormin .1000mg omega oil.1200mg trans resveratrol . 3.5mg naltrexon. vitamin d 5000iu. everyday. but i think 2400mg benzimidazole is enough with 200mg cimetidine and 30ml olive oil..there are no cancer cells in back bone and he can walk 2 hours and play ping pong. the cancer cells in lung is smaller a half now. he has taken these for 2months. ..he have checked liver and blood cells in every 2 weeks...and from now on he takes 1200mg albendazole 200mg cimetidine 30ml olive oil phytocanapinoids 400mg egcg 2400mg meriva curcumin 1000mg metphormin 3.5mg naltrexon 5000iu vitamin d 1000mg olive oil everyday ... ..he plays ping pong for 1 hour everyday..

But guess what it works, stay positive, pray, and always have loving people around you. Get rid of all the negativity in your life from this day forward. Negativity like food for the cancer don’t let it near you. Know there are more and more survivors of cancer now than ever before. I had also immuno therapy. This is what made mine the most wonderful thing. If you get the option of immuno therapy take it it’s one year long and worth every minute that you sit there putting that into your body that teaches our body to fight fight fight. You are loved, and U2 will be  a winner",,,,

,,,,,,"Vegetarian and seafood food helps a lot in overcoming cancer, I heard from a doctor saying that the only thing that defeats cancer, fruits and vegetables, channel that fights cancer Vegan and seafood Sakura #12 , The goal of this channel is not to leave the doctor and your treatment. The goal is for the doctor to tell you that you do not need an immune test and the tumor has become smaller after the doctor’s examination of you.


 there are carbohydrates in the food, I cannot leave you carbohydrates, and the food is delicious and I mix with you a lot of vegetables and fruits, this food is suitable for many categories of vegetarians and dieters and also cancer patients, but caution must be balanced This is a vegetarian system, so watch 3 videos about balancing this system in order not to drop hemoglobin, get osteoporosis, and break blood.

,,,,,,"This is for both of you, a question: I know you are in the middle of the battle of your life, so if this isn’t something you want to answer or have thought about or can handle right now, just scroll on past this.
You two have an identical twin each. Neither of your twins have experienced cancer as well. You are a couple and both have had it within years of each other. 
So my question: I can’t help but wonder if this must’ve been environmentally induced. Some chemical you both consumed in some way- lawn maintenance materials like weed killer, something you both used while building the house, something in your pipes from a home you both lived in, etc...
I imagine you have many, many thoughts and ponder possibilities- but maybe not.
I just think you are unique in that you have another set of your dna walking around without getting caught cancer, which helps to rule out your body just mutating dna. 
Anyway- thanks for hearing me out.",,,,

,,,,,,"Cancer cells are the result of the aging of our cells.  This means that cells age regardless of my age.  There are two causes of accelerated aging of cells.  First, DNA methylation, and second, telomere damage.  A lobster whose telomeres are not extremely damaged does not get cancer, lives an average of 500 years, and an elephant produces 60,000 milligrams (60 grams) of vitamin C per day in its body, and it has plenty of p53 genes, so it does not get cancer.

 Why does DNA methylation occur?
 1. Stress.
 2. Smoking and drinking alcohol
 3. Virus infection and vaccines (vaccination ... including Covid19 vaccines)
 4. Inflammation in the body due to bacterial infection
 5. Meat intake (saturated fat, bad cholesterol)
 6. Body fat (less muscles and sedentary lifestyle)
 7. Not enough vitamin D in the body.  Vitamin C deficiency
 8. Lack of sleep (less melatonin)
 9. Parental genetic issues (activity of the P53 gene)

 Telomere damage is also caused by drinking and smoking, heavy metals, pesticides, burned food, fine dust, pollutants, meat, etc.

 A substance that prevents DNA metallization.  - Tofu (isoflavin).  Resveratrol.  Folic acid.  Vitamin B12.  Curcumin.  Omega 3. Lipozomal vitamin C. Vitamin D. Quercetin.  EGCG

 To improve the p53 gene, take low-dose naltrexone (3.5 mg per day) and alpha-poinic acid.

 , albendazole (or penbendazole or mebendazole1200ㅡ2400 mg and olive oil 50 ml with 200ㅡ400mg cimetidinefor 80mg artovastatin 4 days, quercetin2400mg resveratrol 1200mg egcg 400mg meformin 1000 ml omega 3 meriva curcumin1500mg daily.  take 15 -20grams of liposomal vitamin C, 100 mg of doxycycline, and 500 mg of azithromycin for 3 days when you do not take abz cimetidine artovaszatin after dinner .. Taking a hot  bath for 1 hour a day can cure cancer.  3.5mg naltrexon 5000iu vitamin d every day. The doctor told me that my life ends in a month.but I did this method for 6 months. and i completed i cured cancer..  The cure rate of cancer is around 3% with chemo theraphy and radioactive. If people get cancer again after 5 years, everyone dies with 99% possibility...  albendazole and pbz mbz kill cancer and cancer stem cells.  it happens never again. ..... in korea there are many people who cure cancer with this method.  very quickly and without side effects .....

 12-48mg ivermectin 50mg zinc cure covid 19 for7days (500mg quercetin.5g liposomal vitaminc)

 you can take up to 96mg ivermectin a day .. 20 days straightly.  cancer patients in korea took experiments.  he took 120mg a day for 20 days straightly to cure the terminal cancer ......",,,,

That was a tough time for us. But now she cancer free for 6 year now and we are glad for that. She went through chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. My mom Dr recommended her to do chemotherapy first due to her tumors was hugs and then do Lumpectomy after and then radiation last. At the same time we believed in Natureral way also. My mom a did take Turmeric power with hot water and honey, fresh burdock root, dry soursop leaves, fresh Dandelion leaves, she boil it and drink as tea. She drink it every day. My mom Dr was surprised how fast her tumors was shrink down. She even do her Lumpectomy before her schedule. So please check those 4 things out. Those 4 things help shrink the cancer tumors and fight with cancer. Turmeric root powder, dry soursop leaves, burdock root and Dandelion leaves. For Dandelion leaves, burdock root, Turmeric root powder you can buy it at organic grocery store. Dry soursop leaves you can buy it from Amazon.",,,,

Thank you so much for sharing your journey. Thoughts and prayers to you <3

It really tugs at my heart, because I went through the same exact treatment a few years ago. It is definitely challenging and intense, to say the least. You are so graceful and admirable to share your experience with this heinous disease. As a fellow young survivor (5 years in October!) I commend you for your bravery and strength. You are so inspiring even as I type through my tears watching this. Small tip I like to share: Trader Joe's Coconut-Aloe water and Gin-Gin ginger candies were my saviors during those 16 rounds of ACT chemotherapy. Also, hot epsom salt baths soothed my achy bones after those Neupogen/Neulasta shots. Sending so much love and light your way, gorgeous girl.",,,,

Breast cancer has been in my family for 6 generations now, but whenever my doctor talks to me about imaging, my mentality is, “I’m not worried about it! I’m 28!” My mom was 26 though.... Thank you for reminding me BC it is real and does come at any age.

,,,,,,"Thank you for posting this, I have been putting off going to the doctors for way too long as I have a lot of cancer symptoms but for some reason my fear of hospitals and talking to my family about my health has stopped me every time I plan on going to see my dr. What makes me more frustrated with myself is that I have first found a lump in 2018 and thought nothing of it and now I fear it could be too late for me. I also have autism and find it hard to talk about my self to my family. Ps sorry to put this here just wanted peoples thoughts on how to get around the fear of getting tested. I am going to get checked tomorrow best ever of your video and I’ll think of how strong you are. ❤️❤️",,,,

How's your sister dealing with this with you. Her treatment though was different since it didn't really cause any real issues like regular chemo does. But a lot different. I did shots every other day for 5 months. Didn't have the what you have. ☹️💉 I have to say I felt great the whole time. 👍 I had everyone waiting on me during chemo. 😁 Never felt sick 🤢 ever.,,,,
,,,,,,"God is with you both. I admire the way you are handling this situation and I hope and pray for you to win your battle, I know you’ll do.

,,,,,,"Hello lovely lady!  Did you freak out the first time you tinkled red after your infusion, lol?   They had to lower the amount of Benedryl they gave me because it gave me ""happy feet"".  I'd be tap dancing while seated, to the amusement and entertainment of the other clients being infused.  I preferred getting my infusions in the same room with others.  We had wonderful chats and shared helpful tips.  The first time I had cancer my nails got very thin and grew exceptionally fast.  Thirteen years later it came back and my nails turned yellow/brown and took a long time to grow out pink again.  I'm now in my third cancer battle over a 21 year period.  But I'm still diddy-bopping and enjoying my life!  With today's advanced treatments, you should have a great, lasting recovery.  Praying for our Heavenly Father to bless and heal you. <3 from Missouri.",,,,

,,,,,,I had a port in for 4 years and getting it flushed every month was the worst part about having one in. The sailing tasted sooo bad I hated it sooo bad. I don't have the port in anymore cuz it had come out through my skin so I ended up having to have an emergency surgery last summer. They were not able to take the whole thing out as I had scar tissues build up all around the port and the catheter port. I now still have a an 8 inch catheter port left inside of me. Prayers for you. You are a strong person don't ever give up. 😁,,,,

Curious and a bit concerned about your nutrition, they have any plans of giving you some TPN to help keep you built? (because you’re so tiny already, TPN was a wonderful life saver and ended my malnutrition)
The saline: a positive is that if you can taste saline, you know your port is still good 👍🏻
Edited to add: Heparin is what she is flushing your port with and as she said, blood thinner but it’s important for you to know this, because before any procedure, even dental work, they need to know that you are on blood thinners.",,,,
,,,,,,❤️❤️wishing you the best results,,,,
,,,,,,I am a 2 yr breast cancer survivor. I also had to have chemo 1st. It shrunk my 5 cm tumor to 3. I have a tip for nasty taste the saline flush puts in mouth. Black Forest gummy bears with the liquid center. I tried many candies this works best! Chew a few as they are doing flush and you won't taste it! Also during treatment I used mouthwash for dry mouth and I never got any sores in my mouth. Much love it goes faster than you think!,,,,
,,,,,,You are amazing! I am a 5 year survivor myself. Diagnosed at 29 with the same regimen as you. You are doing great! Lemon heads helps with the saline taste during the port flushes. Keep fighting!,,,,

,,,,,,"Love your energy and soul! I went through chemo Dec 2018 - Apr 2109 for breast cancer as well. I was 64 at the time of diagnosis. I had Stage III C invasive ductile, weak estrogen positive cancer. 8 chemos, 4 Adriamycin/Cytoxan and 4 Taxol which did some damage to the nerves in my feet and hands. Still recovering from that but totally manageable to live with. Utter fatigue, loss of taste and fuzzy tongue, hair loss, restlessness, constipation and overall weakness the worst of it. I didn't lose my nails but they were very brittle, couldn't open up a flip top can or a pistachio nut for the life of me. Also couldn't do buttons, zippers or snaps. Hands were pretty useless from weakness. My chemo shrunk tumor 60%, had mastectomy May 2020 followed by 28 days of radiation. They wanted to do 18 weeks of oral drug Xeloda because I had 3 positive lymph nodes but I couldn't tolerate that drug and quit. They also wanted me to do hormone treatment for 5 years but I refused that. Supposed to really weaken your bones, I didn't want that, plus I felt like I had put my body through enough and now I had to trust it to recover and keep me well. Just getting around to flap surgery at the end of August. Hoping this is the last hump to get over. Sending you love from across the US in NJ! Thank you for posting your journey, it really helps those who are also going through it.",,,,

,,,,,,"9 months after my last treatment my friend told me that my hair has grown back better than before.  Hair loss, being tired all the time and the isolation due to Covid was an added burden but in the end very much a battle worth fighting.   You are brave and beautiful in every way.    It is time someone shows the world what we go through.  Mine was a pic line, 2 hour infusions every two weeks and hour from home.   I think it’s important to let patients know that as bad as it gets, post chemo life can be wonderful.   We come out with a different view as to what is important.  I wish you well, love and happiness.  You are so brave.",,,,

,,,,,,"I admire your strength and smile! You got this! I’m a pediatric oncology nurse and a couple things I’ve found helpful: if flushing the saline makes you nauseous, try getting a peppermint or ginger stick to smell! We offer then to our patients who can’t stand/throw up when we have to flush their port and it works wonders! Also another product that has helped our kiddos is healios mouthwash! One of my patients had such bad mouth sores with her chemo she could barely swallow water but after taking this supplement with her next cycle she was able to eat and drink just fine! Wishing you the best of luck ❤️",,,,

,,,,,,Prayers for you.,,,,
,,,,,,"Delia, you are so strong and so sweet. I hate seeing you go through this. I am confused on why they did chemo first and then maybe surgery? I always thought it's  do the surgery first and get the tumor out, and then chemo..either way you are so so strong!! and courageous 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 praying for you and your family ❤️ ❤️",,,,

Incorrect......Good nutrition is part of it but chemo is also important also...........Keep fighting on.",,,,

,,,,,,"My husband has endured this for six years.  He has a numbing cream that he puts on his port about 30 mins before the stick.  It helps a lot.  He also takes Claritin —NOT THE NON BRAND, but the real Claritin.  It helps with body pain.  Sounds weird, but it works.  He avoids pain pills as much as possible because they constipate and cause gastric issues.  He craves oranges but they aggravate his mouth sores, so orange sherbet push-ups make him happy.  😊 It’s not one day at a time for us, it’s one moment at a time.",,,,
,,,,,,Keeping you in my prayers and thoughts!,,,,
,,,,,,My mama had breast cancer at 43. Not as young as you but I still remember the call. I fell to the ground. She’s now 15 years past it and a survivor.

,,,,,,"Too sad, life is so fragile. Tonight a man crashed into my neighbour's wall, he had a heart attack, he only lived for another 15 minutes. A neighbour phoned the last dialled number on his phone and got hold of his brother. My neighbours all came out to help, this one phoning the ambulance that one a doctor. My husband went to get a nurse we know up in the road and he managed to flag down the police within minutes we had very competent people trying their best to revive him. It just reminded me once again how precious life is and how we should cherish our loved ones.

You two have been through so much already at such a young age, I know this will make you stronger and very empathetic humans.  I'm sending you love from South Africa and will pray and believe like everyone else watching and your loved ones, that you will come out just fine and even stronger at the end of this. 💓",,,,

Your knowledge of this dreaded disease has served you well.  You are realistic while determined to beat the hell out of it.  Forgive my swearing, but it is what it is!  Your positivity will also serve you VERY well, all the while drinking in the goodness of life and loved ones.  Humor is quite an antidote also!  Please know I mean this with all my heart and being!  I just lost my youngish husband to pancreatic cancer on 7/26/21.  We don't know one another but I am so proud of you ❤",,,,

,,,,,,"Dexamethasone is that steroid they give you. I’m assuming Zofran and compazine are the two anti nausea medications they also give to you. It’s so crazy how similar Veterinary oncology is to human oncology. We do the same protocols and use some of the same drugs as well. Doxorubicin is the worst though, I always feel for our patients that get it. Stay strong, you’ve got this!",,,,
,,,,,,I was wondering if the anti nausea meds would make you sleepy because they dope me up and I always wondered if it was just me. You doing this really helps others to have an understanding of treatments and helps reduce fears or hang ups about it.,,,,

I don’t have cancer but I have MS (multiple sclerosis), & was just diagnosed after almost 20 years of symptoms that could not be explained. I am extremely impressed with people who do not allow the scariest diagnoses to take them down, mentally, & when people maintain positivity, which is exactly what I see you doing! I’m sure you have your moments because we all have them, but please keep on fighting hard, kicking cancers ass, because I can tell you have many loved ones, and friends who only want the best for you. I can tell this is not your time, & you are a survivor already, even if it may not feel like it yet. Congratulations on getting to the halfway point, and it’s all uphill from here! I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers, and I can’t wait to see what comes next in your life journey. Much Love from Cali 💞🙏🏻🌹✨",,,,

,,,,,,"Dear Delia, I stumbled upon this video, ironic, I went through this a couple of yrs ago. I see you getting the ""red devil"" infusion.  There is a magic mouth wash they can make up for you to help with the mouth sores, and sore throat.  A really amazing tip for fingernails during chemo.  If you have a nail that breaks low close to end of your finger, I used water proof tape to cover the tear, I cut it round like the finger tip then carefully used emery board to make it fit the nail.  This kept me from losing any finger nails.  My oncologist is still shocked that I didn't lose a single nail. Stay strong, get lots of rest.   You got this girl. I just passed the 2 yr NED.  Watching this brought back so many memories. Sending you lots of love, light, and healing energy.♥ And to help with the body pain from the Nuelasta Taking Claritin the day before during and after can help make that not so bad. They can also prescribe some numbing gel to put on the port prior to treatment to lower the pain in that area. I made it though 16 rounds of chemo. I know that you can do it. There is so much love coming in for you",,,,

The second one is Jell-O. Someone brought her in lime Jell-O which is the most flavor she doesn’t like. But she said she felt like it was soothing all the way down to her stomach.. She said that sometimes water felt too thick for her to drink. So Jell-O was it. Also she use Jell-O just to drink before it set up and that helped to.She also said A&E ointment for when you have to use the restroom. Sending Prayers Your Way, God bless you and Dylan and your whole family through what you’re going through.",,,,

I lost my very best friend to breast cancer she was only 38 years old. I wish she had your drive your positive attitude and knowledge on her illness and her recovery.  I truly can’t say or express  how in awe I am with you and  the amazing human that you are. I think after Dylan went through his cancer and now you it starts to make me question my faith, and then I remember how good God is and the amazing miracles that we see everyday and you truly are one of those miracles. I know in my heart and in my gut that you are going to get through this and come out the other side if possible even better than you were going in.

 Which took longer as his WBC was none at times. Then  every 6 weeks inpatient for 3 days for chemo infusions and pill. My heart breaks for you as I know how my 13 year old felt. Though hard for me to watch. That's the least I can do for you. I think it's great they let you video.  The other day I took one of my other son's, he's disabled to his physical. He hasn't left the house at all through this world mess. He asked me to do a vlog of him getting a vaccine so I could post for other kids to see. I told  the nurse giving the vaccine that she would not be in the video and if I could video it and why. What does she say. A VERY mean, "" No I'm not letting you"" Broke my heart. As she hurt my son's feelings who just wanted to show other kids it's ok. So sad ppl in the medical field here are so cruel. Glad you get good care. You are very brave. We pray for you every night

Even still it’s lonely by myself but I don’t know any different 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’ve had mouth sores and blisters for almost 2 years and it’s no fun. It’s wonderful you have your husband by your side. I remember the “red devil” when I was first going through chemo infusion. Lost my hair after 2nd treatment. I keep my hair short. It’s easier to manage.

,,,,,,,I would've never known something wasn't right with my prostate If I didn't decide to go on TRT at 40 years old.. I don't know why normal blood panels don't include PSA. When I got my bloodwork from my wellness doctor psa was 2.03 which is supposedly normal under 4.0..got on TRT and it jumped up to 3.8. came off (this is all within a year) and psa went back down to 2.11..went back on TRT and psa went back up. saw a urologist and he immediately says biopsy..I was taken aback thinking it was a very aggressive move so for 5 months did some research and with a push from the wife I decided to go back and tell him I want the biopsy..although I don't know why they wouldn't do an MRI first..biopsy is tomorrow. better safe than sorry..Im spreading the word to everyone I come across in health/fitness/life conversations.,,,
,,,,,,,I opted for removal too. I did educate myself. After listening to Ben i decided to have mine removed. He has lots of money and can afford the best. Why not?,,,
,,,,,,,If you keep a check on your PSA and it starts going up then the Doctor or Urologist will probably want to do a Biopsy that's what my Urologist just done for me he said they would take 12 core samples he done this Biopsy in the hospital and I was completely knocked out when it was over and I came to he told me he took 21 core samples a week later I went back to his office and he said 2 of the samples came back positive for cancer but he said my Gleason score is 6 which he said is a low grade cancer he wants to just monitor me closely to see if my PSA goes up then if it does he will do another Biopsy but I am kinda scared i think i will ask about just having my prostate completely removed i think that would be best but our small town hospital only does the open you up method and not the robotic surgery but there is another hospital 30 miles away that does the robotic surgery that's another decision i will have to make. Man life comes at you hard when you get older. Good luck to anyone reading this if you're in the same boat i am in oh yea my PSA is 3.7,,,
,,,,,,,Ben is a wise man.  He chose life.,,,
,,,,,,,"We never knew about a PSA test. My husband was diagnosed on his 48th birthday with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. Too late for surgery. Terrible damage to his nervous system because of the tumors. He had ZERO symptoms and no family history. Doctors never did this test as the insurance said he was too young for it to be protocol. He went through Chemo, radiation, hormone therapy and life is very very painful for him now. There needs to be better representation of prostate cancer and to let people know to ask for this PSA test that can easily be added to your yearly bloodwork simply by asking. Pay out of pocket for that test!!!!!!!",,,
,,,,,,,"prostate cancer is not dangerous anymore , you go to operation and remove the prostat ,you never feel pain in connection to surgery , just take rest after surgery and start running after two month ,",,,
,,,,,,,There is another option and that is the natural way.,,,
,,,,,,,Great interview. Ben told the truth here - huge respect for him as a man. Matt asked all the right questions and I still think he’s one of the best interviewers out there,,,
,,,,,,,"For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before deciding whether to be screened, men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision. Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men. However, many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. CLINICIANS SHOULD NOT SCREEN MEN WHO DO NOT EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR SCREENING.",,,
,,,,,,,"My husband may have prostate cancer and is 44, he is going through tests now. Thank you so much Ben and Ben's Doctor for this video. It gave me hope ❤",,,
,,,,,,,"I’ll never have a PSA test. It is NOT a screening test for prostate cancer. That’s a myth. 70% of prostate tumors are BENIGN and in the past no one differentiated between the aggressive and benign tumors (70% of them). This is medical information from the last Century! I’m almost 65, have never had a PSA Test and never will. My body. My choice.",,,
,,,,,,,"Read the books ""Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers"" and ""The Key to Prostate Cancer"" by Dr Scholz who is a Prostate Oncologist. Everything you need to know about Prostate Cancer is in those books. Don't do like Ben did and have his Prostate removed, which I assume he did because he didn't research it. Prostate removal is probably the worse choice with radiation being better. Also Needle biopsy is being replaced with 3T Multiparametric MRI, Which is safer than a biopsy,  and isn't painful. If you go to a Urologist (who are surgeons) guess what he'll suggest Prostatectomy. I had a PSA of 6 and my Urologist said I could have it removed or do active surveillance. I chose to just keep an eye on it and if it started climbing Do something then. That was 17 years ago, and I'm now 80 years old, and have never had to do anything except monitor my PSA and have occasional Color Doppler Ultrassound scans. My PSA had climbed to 11 a year ago, and I started taking 3 tablespoons of grround Flaxseed meal every day, and my PSA went down to 8.8. At my age I don't expect to every have to do anything and will likely die from something other than Prostate Cancer. There is so much to learn about the subject spend some time and read everything you can find especially the books by Dr Scholz.",,,

As soon as it went up I had robotic surgery. 1 yr later >.014 psa, the outcome isn't as horrible as you think if you get it early. Besides, tri mix takes care of any erectile issues, works AWESOME, a lot less work. Good for you Ben.",,,
,,,,,,,"Does anyone here know of any web sites that have people talking about their cancers and their treatments to cure the cancer naturally or with any methods besides surgery or radiation? Or outcomes of surgery or radiation? I think those sites, if there are, would be the greatest to read and learn from. Straight from the horses mouth.  

I have prostate cancer which was under active surveillance of Gleason 6 or Group 1.  Now after a PSMA PET scan my doctor claims I am now in Group 2 and is going to possibly recommend surgery or radiation when I meet with him next.  My PSA is within normal for my age of 4.2.    I want to learn from others that have gone through other methods of treatments for prostate cancer or other cancers and  have been successful to get rid of the cancer.

This is a very odd cancer to have and it is so confusing trying to learn on the internet what works and what is truthful.

There is emerging epidemiology data supporting the connection between increased tomato consumption and reduced risk for both cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer.

Recent animal studies have investigated tomatoes, lycopene, and prostate cancer using the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and Dunning rat models.
These animal studies also suggest that diets containing tomatoes may decrease the risk or the progression of prostate cancer. Due to the frequency and the extent of tomato consumption, the supporting epidemiological and animal data, which connect increased intakes with decreased cancer and cardiovascular disease risk, tomato's role in the American diet is of undeniable importance as part of a healthy diet.",,,

One should clean the seat with Germ X, and one should take his own toilet paper to the restroom. Prostate Cancer and Prostatitis are issues that are too technical and one must be very careful.

I have tried almost everything but I couldn’t find any solution for the virus, despite all these happening to me, I always spend a lot of money to buy HIV drugs and other supplements to keep me healthy and taking several medications. Until one day I was just surfing through YouTube  when I came across a great post from Anita, who said that she was diagnosed with HIV and was healed through the help of this great herbal supplements of Dr Harvey, Sometimes I really wonder why people call him the  great Dr.Harvey, I never knew it was all because of the great and perfect work that he has been doing. So I quickly contacted him and told him everything happening to me, and he asked me a few questions and he said something I will never forget, that anyone who contacts him is always getting his/her cure within a few weeks after doing all he asks them to do. So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I'm HIV negative wow.

There, I learned that there was a tumor blocking my liver duct—the cause of the stomach distress—and that I had Stage 3 pancreatic cancer. I had no prior family history of the disease and was only 44-years-old at the time of diagnosis. I tried so many treatment but still no change, until a friend of mine told me about Dr Harvey, he told me how Dr Harvey cured his uncle with his Herbal Products and suggested I contact him ,so I quickly contacted him and explained everything to him and he assured me that his Herbal Products  will cure me which I strongly believed ,so I purchased it and he told me  how to use it which I did , after some time I started noticing some changes in my body after 30 days I went for a test and to my greatest surprise the result was negative, Wow I’m so happy about this, thank you so much Dr Harvey. you can also contact Dr Harvey on VIA EMAIL: (Drharveyphytotherapy@yahoo.com)

,,,,,,,"I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013 at the age of 49.  After routine blood work, which included PSA, my primary care doctor said my PSA level was high for my age (2.8) he referred me to a urologist for a biopsy.  Urologist was skeptical, stating that my PSA was within normal range and didn't know why my Primary care Dr. referred me to him, but he did perform a biopsy, and found that I did indeed have cancer, a small speck according to him.  After discussing it with the Urologist and my doctor, I decided not to get immediate treatment, but wait and watch.  It's been six years and I get a PSA checked every 6 months, I'm still within normal range, last PSA was 3.4. I really think my prostate cancer is due to me taking DHEA for several years, which is a testosterone enhancement. I quit taking it in 2013 when I was diagnosed at my doctors urging.",,,
,,,,,,,"Age 52, diagnosed just this past February, started hormone therapy in March because I was told it was the aggressive kind of prostate cancer, will be having my prostate removed tomorrow by a robot (guided by the doctor of course) & will be on hormone therapy for the next 18 months. Last year my doctor had me do the PSA blood test & the results were elevated, but she said she didn't think it was cancer because if it was the levels would be in the 60s (mine was at 14). She was more concerned with my bp...she was fired in December & I saw a urologist, because I had a bladder obstruction, which caused me to retain 30lbs of fluids & also cause my kidneys to start failing. Had a CT scan & my prostate didn't look abnormal, but the doctor scheduled a TURP & biopsy at the same time in February (he kept me on a catheter for over a month!), but was not able to pee without self-catheterizing myself, so he did a half-arsed job on the TURP. I fired HIM because of that and his inability to give me straight answers and found a much better urologist who examined me and suggested the hormone therapy to lower the testosterone (which, testosterone helps spread the micro pieces of cancer that can't be detected) and to have a robotic laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.
Don't know how much of the nerves or lymph nodes they'll be able to save, but again, would you rather have a few inconveniences & possibly extend/save your life or take you chances? I'm 52, but I don't think that's old and opted to do whatever it takes to extend/save my life over a few inconveniences. No family history of prostate cancer (my father's brother got it, but he was exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam & has had other forms of cancer & problems from that, too), but there is a history of cancer in my family (mother died of ovarian cancer & I've had 2 cousins who survived breast cancer).

Bottom line: guys, if you're over 40, take it seriously & get tested. It might just save your life by detecting it & treating it early. One of the most survivable types of cancer. Find a good doctor. If the one you find isn't giving you straight answers or giving you the runaround or giving answers you don't like, get a second or third or even fourth opinion. This isn't something to put off, ignore, or play around with. Early detection & treatment will give you the best shot at surviving it. I, for one, plan to be around for a few more decades & hope, after tomorrow, things will be free & clear of me having cancer.",,,

,,,,,,,"I highly recommend reading about the doctor that invented the PSA test. His name is Richard Ablin and his book is called the Treat Prostate Hoax. 
The test is not cancer specific, it stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen, a protein produced by the prostate. It rises and falls depending on when your tested. Just because you have a high psa test, which is above 4.0, according to the medical establishment, doesn't mean you have cancer. Getting biopsy requires the doctor to poke the prostate all over since they have no clue where or if you have it. It's painful and unnecessary. I hear they now have a machine that can check the prostate with ultrasound which is a lot less evasive. In any case, I would read Dr. Albin's book before you decide to do anything.",,,

,,,,,,,,"WOULD'VE , SHOULD'VE, COULD'VE, ...?WHERE did it GET you⁉️"". The words many who KNOW who they are, will have to live with forever. I have a sister 14 yrs younger than me. A musical genius who graduated a yr early from HS, & a year early with HONORS, earning TWO bachelor degrees from BERKLEE College of Music in Boston. She's been an alcoholic for over 10 years & has lived on the streets of Camden NJ & NYC. YES, we offered her help but addicts will choose their path to sobriety if & when THEY are ready. She fortunately did but will never be the same sister I once had💔🙏  BUT....the ONE thing I ALWAYS did & still do, & the ONE simple yet sometimes  life saving thing an addict like Aaron Carter will Never refuse, are phone calls from family! Just to say ""I LOVE YOU, How are YOU?""⁉️And NOW that this talented loving young man is gone, he's getting more attention & Love that he ever asked for! I know nothing about his life but if he didn't at least get this, then SHAME on ALL of you! For the past yrs I watched & enjoyed this talented, funny young man who was full of life & had dreams of a successful future. I had Faith in him, as his dedicated fans did also.  We encouraged him & gave him the support he so desperately needed & deserved. He was obviously an extremely talented young  man who was chewed up & spit out by the industry regardless of his  circumstances. We should all be grown enough to have empathy & common sense to understand his young fame & sometimes the repercussions  that can go with it. But if you were his family, I can only hope you at least picked up that phone to call him, send a card & have said those words....""I Love You, How are you doing?""  I am deeply heartbroken at his loss. He didn't get to know how he had a positive impact on so many people's lives. I myself have had a difficult year & watching Aaron live got me through to a better place again. He innocently opened his life live to his fans & to the haters who made cruel comments that I would wonder ""WHAT kind of person raised evil trash like them"" to say such things to another human being.  Thank you Aaron, for sharing your sense of humor, , your amazing songs you wrote, the birth of your precious son, & hearing your excitement of plans you had for your future. It's very unfortunate you gave so much of yourself to us & never asked ANYTHING back in return but for Love, understanding & acceptance, & a chance you worked for most certainly earned!👍💯💖 You never got to know you saved me (& I'm sure many others) as watching you got me through my difficult time.  Meanwhile our hands are tied to return the favor & you tragically  lose your life, yet you saved mine & I'm sure many others. I never got a chance to say thank you young man, I still have faith & believe in you.😓    (RIP) Aaron Carter 🌹🙏",,

So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I'm HIV negative wow.

Although effective anti-HIV drugs have transformed HIV into a chronic manageable condition you live with rather than die from- taking life-long therapy is a very different proposition to being definitively cured. I put it to the whole human race that there is an affordable , scalable HIV cure that worked as well as would put the global eradication of new HIV infections within reach, while also transforming the lives of those now living with the virus. given the effectiveness of this drugs in both treating and preventing HIV infection, I will say to everyone reading this , that I'm a living witness to it. unlike fraudsters and online scammers who will play you and leave you frustrated with lose of money and hope, this drugs cost less and it is worth a try. if you are interested in getting cured of your HIV, and all kinds of cancer and other deadly diseases Below is the communication link of the doctor who has the new medicine which I took that got me cured totally.

💚💚💚💚ambas as plantas. A diminuição das células fluorescentes com P-1 variou de 6 a 96% sob protocolo virucida e 27 a 82% no procedimento terapêutico, para ambas as plantas. Também demonstramos que a inibição de ambos os vírus foi mais pronunciada sob o protocolo terapêutico. Esta descoberta foi apoiada pela IFA; no entanto, foram encontrados resultados conflitantes para as frações Aq e EtOAc de S. adstringens contra P-1 com o método virucional.
Taninos, flavonóides, antraquinonas e polissacarídeos, entre outros, são compostos encontrados em extratos vegetais e foram implicados na inibição da replicação do vírus in vitro.6,10,12,13,15). Estes compostos demonstraram atuar no estágio inicial da adsorção ou nas estruturas da superfície do vírus, inibindo assim a penetração em células susceptíveis. Esses modos de ação favorecem a base do protocolo virucida como a abordagem mais relevante para determinar o efeito antiviral (eventualmente, profilática, onde as células são tratadas antes da infecção). No entanto, nossos resultados demonstraram que, em geral, o protocolo terapêutico foi mais consistente, embora ainda não conheçamos a natureza dos compostos antivirais. A identificação desses compostos é crucial para uma melhor compreensão do mecanismo antiviral. Em conclusão, o extrato bruto e as frações de G. ulmifolia e S. adstringens demonstraram inibir a replicação de BHV-1 e P-1 quando testados quanto ao efeito na infectividade viral e na presença de antígenos virais em células infectadas. Sugerimos que o efeito antiviral seja mais provável após a entrada das cepas de vírus nas fases subseqüentes de sua replicação em cultura de células",,

,,,,,,,,"They say they can isolate HIV, and measure ""viral loads"" with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. But why is it that the scientist who won a Nobel Prize for inventing the PCR test, Kary Mullis, says HIV does not cause AIDS? Dr. Peter Duesberg was the first scientist to isolate the cancer gene. He was also the first scientist to discover and map out the genome sequence of the retrovirus. He agrees that HIV does not cause AIDS. Also, Dr. Rodney Richards, one of the first scientists to create the first HIV antibody test, disagrees with the ""HIV causes AIDS"" hypothesis. Ettiene de Harven, published first images of budding virus through EM, and he does not agree with the HIV hypothesis. Even Luc Montagnier, who won a Nobel Prize in 2007 for supposedly discovering HIV, publicly announced at the 1990 AIDS conference that HIV did not, after all, kill T-cells and could not be the cause of AIDS. Montagnier also admitted on French TV, in 1997, that he never isolated the virus — and neither has anyone else. (rethinkingaids)on Facebook",,

After that I’ve been feeling some weird pains on both of my rib cage sides, and on both sides of abdomen, starts 1 hour after I eat. Pain not constant, it comes and goes. Some contipation, 

12 months ago ULTRASOUND showed multiple tiny polyps in gallbladder,

I don't think he did any work for his job.  He then got sick again.  More chemo.  I think radiation.  I don't recall.  He passed that November.  Worse day of all of our lives.

,,,,,,,,,"WHAT IS RSO 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     RSO stands for Rick Simpson Oil which is a full extract cannabis oil meant to be taken orally or applied topically. RSO is a marijuana extract made utilizing a solvent to extract cannabinoids. The best solvent used for extraction is Everclear Solvent this is because it is highly edible. Some producers uses naphtha solvent for extraction which is highly dangerous for human consumption because it contains a very toxic gas that can help to kill you rather than helping you that is why you see some patients consume RSO and complain of numerous side effects whereas proper made RSO does not give any side effects.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RSO AND CBD?   CBD oil derived from industrial hemp plants only contain CBD, while Rick Simpson Oil has a high concentration of THC of at least 80% and the full range of cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. RSO is made using top quality organic indica strains which contains thousands of healing properties whereas CBD is derived  from hemp which contains very limited healing properties. RSO is capable of healing almost every ailment whereas CBD can only help to provide relief but can not heal.

WHAT IS THE RSO 90 DAYS PROTOCOL?      RSO Suggested Protocol  The goal of a RSO protocol is to consume 60 grams of Rick Simpson Oil in 90 days. This is a very large
amount of cannabis oil and should be taken with caution, increasing the dose gradually to avoid adverse
effects. Below is a suggested outline for increasing the dose until the recommended 1 gram per day dose is
achieved.

Week 1: Start with 3 doses per day (morning, midday, before bed) every 8 hours
Half of a grain of rice per dose

Week 2-5: Double your dose every 4 days, maintaining the 3x per day schedule

Week 5-12: 1 gram per day (split across 3 doses) until the entire 60 grams of oil is consumed

Week 12+: Reduce to a maintenance dose (1-2 grams total per month)

SIDE EFFECTS. 
Patients starting a RSO protocol should plan appropriately as the potential for side effects is greater during the
first three to four weeks of the protocol when consume more than the recommended dose. That is why it's always advisable to follow the protocol and maintain the right dose recommended. Once a tolerance is built most patients report few to no negative side
effects. The most common side effect is sleepiness and sedation, with quality sleep being an important aspect
of the healing process.

RSO Topical Use:
Like Rick’s original success, many patients use RSO topically for skin cancers. To do this, place a small
amount of RSO on the affected area and cover with a bandage, changing the bandage and applying more oil
every 1-3 days. Many patients report that over time the cancerous spots will dry, crack, and diminish. After the
area has healed, it’s recommended to continue applying RSO for at least two weeks.

HOW DOES RSO TASTE? 
High quality  RSO got a pleasant taste and smell that is the reason why most patient find it preferable to ingest the oil as to get a more better and  faster result.

HOW LONG DOES RSO TAKE TO WORK?  
The effects of the oil, similar to most forms of cannabis ingested orally, may take up to an hour to feel the effects. Rick goes on to say the max dose you should consume is a full gram and you should stick with this dose for the remainder of the 12 weeks.

Is RSO Decarboxylated?   
Also known as full extract cannabis oil because it provides patients with full-spectrum benefits in oil form. RSO is fully decarboxylated. The decarboxylation ensures that THC-A will become activated (or psychoactive),

Is RSO stronger than distillate? 
RSO is thought to be a more “raw” form of concentrate as it retains more plant matter than distillate, which strips away some of it during the extraction process. It's also an easier DIY method that results in a highly potent final product.

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL BENEFITS OF RSO?   The principle benefits of using RSO have been publicized in relation to cancer treatments, but span into other categories as well. As a concoction high in THC, RSO has been said to have benefits that include treating arthritis, insomnia, depression, high blood pressure, and a variety of other major diseases.

So I quickly contacted him and told him everything happening to me, and he asked me a few questions and he said something I will never forget, that anyone who contacts him is always getting his/her cure within a few weeks after doing all he asks them to do. So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I'm HIV Negative wow.

same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = 
being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's 
what Acts 2:38 is. 
We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, 
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that 
OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not 
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. 
St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he 
cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. 
We can't come up with our own 
gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven preach 
any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
 him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, 
Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match-up with the 
scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. 
Eternity
 is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in 
them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of 
me. 
The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The 
book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter 
the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to
 show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. 
It's
 better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong 
direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts
 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. 
Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and 
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Jesus 
Christ was our perfect example back to God. He was baptized and received
 the Holy Ghost and we must be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. He 
was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in 
righteousness. He died and rose again, and we must die to the things of 
this world and rise to walk in the newness of life. He prayed to the 
father showing us how to pray to the father. If you believe in this 
message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you!",

,,,,,,,,,,This video is giving me chills. My grandma was the same way when she found out she had cancer. Just the most positive person she could be in that situation. However I know how evil cancer is now and how it took all her hope at the end and it was just suffering wich is sadly the reality in most cases. So I hope she will not be too sad if she cant hold her humor and positivity for too long. I wish her all the best.
