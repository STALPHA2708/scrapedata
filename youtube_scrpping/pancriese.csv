Is this woman still alive?  This was made 9 years ago and pancreatic cancer is not as curable as she claimed.  It's one of the most difficult cancers to treat.
"Hi Kim  I had Throat Cancer and got discharged after 5 years, I am now in my 4th year remission from my Pancreatic Cancer. 
 I   have fought through my Throat cancer and Pancreatic Cancer through two famous songs that I have re written all of the lyrics to, about fighting and surviving Cancer. You can find them on YouTube just type Cancer Rebel Live, Cancer Survivor 
P.s I hope you like the songs, especially the cancer survivor one. Please feel free to share them if you like.
Stay safe and well, all the best Maurice McCarthy Somerset England."

"Hi, 4 months ago I had my first cancer Removed on top of my right kidney, was 1.8 cm RCC grade 2. 
Successfully removed without any issue, a month before the surgery I had AN MRI showed nothing else besides that only mass on top of kidney, 

I drank a bottle of red wine throughout 8 hour period while watching movies, eating fatty food, 
After that I‚Äôve been feeling some weird pains on both of my rib cage sides, and on both sides of abdomen, starts 1 hour after I eat. Pain not constant, it comes and goes. Some contipation, 

12 months ago ULTRASOUND showed multiple tiny polyps in gallbladder, 

Does anyone think it could be a sign of early Cancer putting a pressure on both sides of my abdomen? 
I feel these pains every night when I‚Äôm about to wake up, not super strong pain, it comes and goes."
"""hey! I heard that cancer guy you beat was pretty strong"""
"The most devastating cancer, it's a vicious disease"
Most pancreatic cancers are found at stage 4 because symptoms usually don‚Äôt appear till it has spread to other organs & lymph nodes.
Amazing I‚Äôm a blood cancer survivor‚ù§ check out my story on my channel
u suck get worse.
"My Dad died from pancreatic, and his dad died from pancreatic. It is very scary for me, I stay vigilant."
Hope this not a promotion to this place as people are seriously ill
Glad to hear that! Was your tumor localised and had not spread to the liver or other organs

"My daddy also is pancreatic cancer, my heart is broken... Pray for him please"
"My brother diagnosed pancreatic cancer stage 3 inoperable state in aug2022. underwent chemo therapy, now it got reduced to 40%. I would like to know more about vaccine therapy and proton therapy. what is it? how can i ask our  doctor? Please help me anyone knows more about this."
"i lost   my wife, she found out when she was in stage 4....you are one lucky woman, 60 days later she was gone. the chemo shortened her life......  the best to you"
Can you please respond back to me. I have Chronic Pancreatitis and mine is chronic due to alcoholism. I had 2 seizures already and nearly died on the operating table. I was sent to San Francisco in a helicopter it was that bad. Can you please tell me more about how you got it and how it develops? I have trouble breathing and my DT'S from alcohol are not helping. My doctor told me to not stop drinking abruptly as it may cause another seizure. The only thing holding my body together is alcohol. I wish someone would tell me what to do. Please help me in any way you can. Thank you for your video.
It‚Äôs high time everyone reach out to #drosuma for all kinds of health issues such as herpes virus ! Bad breath! Cancer ! A very big thank you for making me be my self ...
can she beat goku tho?
I have no insurance :(
Pray for my uncle he was recently diagnosed with this cancer! üò¢
What was the test?
Thank you doctors! I survived this terrible illness too in 2012!
"I have same cancer at 55, but sadly mine is inoperable. My only medical treatment is chemotherapy, which I just had my 12th round today!!! But I'm taking the multi-modal approach; positivity, prayer, faith, love, having goals, living every day to its fullest, and reconnecting with old friends. I do whatever feels good in my soul. Prayers welcome, hope I get as lucky. 
Peace and love to all, xxoo  Sandra"
I hope this is sincere but keep in mind at the end of the day this is an advertisement
Sometimes die is better than living...
God bless you
I have pancreatic cancer. I called Penn twice and never received a call back. Went to JHH.
Did they also tell you to eat differently while you were going through all that therapy? Like cut out sugar and all whites? Eat a certain way? Is that what you call fighting it? Besides staying positive? Thank you and I hope you are still cancer free üíïü§ó
"I‚Äôm scared I might have pancreatic cancer.  Since May 2022, I‚Äôve had consistent upper back pain, and no matter how much I eat, I‚Äôm not putting on weight.  My MRI is set for December 7, 2022."
i have a friend whos been given a few weeks to live because of this pancreatic cancer i dont think he has any chances but im still praying
"Pancreatic cancer is a death sentence for the vast majority of us I know it because I have it, I would like to ask a follow up question to Penn Medical is Kim still alive in now in November 30 2022? I doubt it."
only in ohio
GOD Bless you Kim! I pray GOD keeps you cancer free from here on out.
"So glad you had a doctor who cared that sent you to get the appropriate tests right away. Many of us aren‚Äôt that fortunate doctors can be cruel by dismissing symptoms, pain and concern."
Where was the pain and how constant
"Looking back on your diagnosis was there any symptoms that you missed. This may help others seek medical help before it progresses. It‚Äôs great that your a fighter, and I wish you well."
"My healthy friend was diagnosed in August with Pancreatic cancer, died in December. Gone, just like that."
"Kim, listening to your success story, I'm crying.  My dad suffered.  Pancreatic cancer is very cruel.  He had the surgery, radiation seeds, chemo.  This was early 1992.  He was able to do his job from home early.  He was misdiagnosed and treated for some stomach ailment.  After the surgery, we all had hope.  Dad and mom went to the campground most of that summer.  I don't think he did any work for his job.  He then got sick again.  More chemo.  I think radiation.  I don't recall.  He passed that November.  Worse day of all of our lives. I have since learned about sodium bicarbonate to increase the body's pH.  I am so, so glad for you.  I'm sure you had a lot of people praying for you.  5% survival rate.  You beat the odds!  No doubt your testimony will save many lives."
She seems a bit crazy
Half the battle is finding a doctor who doesn't blow off your symptoms.  There are ENDLESS stories online and on YouTube about patients who had symptoms of cancers and it took YEARS to get a correct diagnosis because their doctor(s) would not take them seriously.
My husband passed from this
Wow
How did they find your cancer?
but she can‚Äôt beat goku
"My maternal aunt died from pancreatic cancer yesterday . She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer before 8 months . We did all the things we could have for her . Chemotherapy and alot of other treatments . But she didn't make it üò≠ . She was like a mother to me . I used to call her big mother . Losing your loved ones from diseases like this is awful .  
You are lucky i wish my big mother were lucky too like you"
my mums lost to pancreatic it‚Äôs unfair as an 18 year old but thats life
Was it a CT scan?
Can I ask what test you had to determine your diagnosis..
What is Penn?
Wonder how she is now?
"Chemo is not the only option! Chemotherapy, radiation, and other invasive drugs are acceptable medical procedures IF THEY WORK. However, the issue is that they only occasionally work. Today's cancer patients are unaware that alternative cancer treatments based on the body and actual science exist and have the potential to significantly reduce or even completely eradicate harmful cancer cells."
Patients with cancer don't usually die from cancer they die from the treatment and drugs that's what shortens peoples life.
"God Bless. My mother( retired nurse) passed 4 yrs ago Pancreatic cancer. I wish her Dr. listened to her. She knew something was wrong, kept returning to him. He told her get a new  mattress and watch her posture! Only a substitute Dr. filling in for her Dr. realized her symptoms and immediately sent her for testing. By then it was to late, stage 4. She always told me and I wish that she would have done this if you‚Äôre not happy with the first diagnosis get a second opinion or even a third it will not hurt.!"
I'm so happy for your success and your spirit.
"Kim they have a cure. Hope you get to know in Providence Hospital in Portland, OR they have cured pancreatic cancer with cell treatment."
Fuck cancer
"WHAT IS RSO 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     RSO stands for Rick Simpson Oil which is a full extract cannabis oil meant to be taken orally or applied topically. RSO is a marijuana extract made utilizing a solvent to extract cannabinoids. The best solvent used for extraction is Everclear Solvent this is because it is highly edible. Some producers uses naphtha solvent for extraction which is highly dangerous for human consumption because it contains a very toxic gas that can help to kill you rather than helping you that is why you see some patients consume RSO and complain of numerous side effects whereas proper made RSO does not give any side effects.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RSO AND CBD?   CBD oil derived from industrial hemp plants only contain CBD, while Rick Simpson Oil has a high concentration of THC of at least 80% and the full range of cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. RSO is made using top quality organic indica strains which contains thousands of healing properties whereas CBD is derived  from hemp which contains very limited healing properties. RSO is capable of healing almost every ailment whereas CBD can only help to provide relief but can not heal.

WHAT IS THE RSO 90 DAYS PROTOCOL?      RSO Suggested Protocol  The goal of a RSO protocol is to consume 60 grams of Rick Simpson Oil in 90 days. This is a very large
amount of cannabis oil and should be taken with caution, increasing the dose gradually to avoid adverse
effects. Below is a suggested outline for increasing the dose until the recommended 1 gram per day dose is
achieved.

Week 1: Start with 3 doses per day (morning, midday, before bed) every 8 hours
Half of a grain of rice per dose

Week 2-5: Double your dose every 4 days, maintaining the 3x per day schedule

Week 5-12: 1 gram per day (split across 3 doses) until the entire 60 grams of oil is consumed

Week 12+: Reduce to a maintenance dose (1-2 grams total per month)

SIDE EFFECTS. 
Patients starting a RSO protocol should plan appropriately as the potential for side effects is greater during the
first three to four weeks of the protocol when consume more than the recommended dose. That is why it's always advisable to follow the protocol and maintain the right dose recommended. Once a tolerance is built most patients report few to no negative side
effects. The most common side effect is sleepiness and sedation, with quality sleep being an important aspect
of the healing process.

RSO Topical Use:
Like Rick‚Äôs original success, many patients use RSO topically for skin cancers. To do this, place a small
amount of RSO on the affected area and cover with a bandage, changing the bandage and applying more oil
every 1-3 days. Many patients report that over time the cancerous spots will dry, crack, and diminish. After the
area has healed, it‚Äôs recommended to continue applying RSO for at least two weeks.

HOW DOES RSO TASTE? 
High quality  RSO got a pleasant taste and smell that is the reason why most patient find it preferable to ingest the oil as to get a more better and  faster result.

HOW LONG DOES RSO TAKE TO WORK?  
The effects of the oil, similar to most forms of cannabis ingested orally, may take up to an hour to feel the effects. Rick goes on to say the max dose you should consume is a full gram and you should stick with this dose for the remainder of the 12 weeks.

Is RSO Decarboxylated?   
Also known as full extract cannabis oil because it provides patients with full-spectrum benefits in oil form. RSO is fully decarboxylated. The decarboxylation ensures that THC-A will become activated (or psychoactive),

Is RSO stronger than distillate? 
RSO is thought to be a more ‚Äúraw‚Äù form of concentrate as it retains more plant matter than distillate, which strips away some of it during the extraction process. It's also an easier DIY method that results in a highly potent final product.

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL BENEFITS OF RSO?   The principle benefits of using RSO have been publicized in relation to cancer treatments, but span into other categories as well. As a concoction high in THC, RSO has been said to have benefits that include treating arthritis, insomnia, depression, high blood pressure, and a variety of other major diseases.

"I'm glad that she won the battle. But I wish that she went into more detail with her symptoms. Just a ""stomach ache"" could be anything and there are different levels of acheing. Was it burning? Was it cramping? Which part of the stomach did the pain occur? Was the pain constant or was it intermittent? Etc

This was just a promo for the cancer centre"
My father is suffering this disease kindly pray for himm...kindly tell me more...if patient is normal just weight  losting..nd yellowish eyes any chance too live ..we are poor peoples
Two years ago I was a twelve year old girl who lost both my uncle and grandma to pancreatic cancer. First my uncle got it then it was like my grandma manifested it in herself. I lost both of them in the same year. It almost takes my breath away to hear someone can survive it. After their deaths I strongly believe that cancer is a business and can be cured. For the last years I have been researching my ass off and looking for cures. I‚Äôve changed my diet and found natural things that healed many of my sicknesses. I still think they could still be alive. That woman has been through hell and is very strong. Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
I'd love to hear an update from this lady. Hopefully she's still alive and this crap didn't come back. Really hoping they come up with better treatments for this cancer. The survival rate is still insanely low!
Wonderful story

"It sounds like what is happening to me, I was operated on, after 3 months of chemo 1/2 my pancreas, & my gall bladder removed, then a further 3 months chemo, the strongest chemo legal, and while still on this chemo the cancer came back. I am booked in to radio therapy early in nov to see if they can slow it down to buy me more time, my radiologist has not given me much hope of surviving 12 months. I am like you and say that I will beat this, I have a strong mindset.. but I feel like I am being written off and am unsure where to turn next in my journey back to health."

Thank you for sharing my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer yesterday
"My wife took her sister to the ER because she was hurting. She thought it just bad heartburn but they found pancreatic cancer in her. It had already gotten in her liver. She was in Stage 4 and we never even knew it. She spent 7 days in the hospital and was sent home on hospice. She came and stayed with us for 3 days and on the 4th night, she had a massive stroke in her sleep. We called 911 and they took her to the hospital where she died later that day. 11 days after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, she die. That was a month ago and we are still in disbelief."
Thank you for sharing. Would love to know how she is doing now. Blessed!

"My name is Sunli gandhi,  Dr. Harvey is the only  herbal doctor who could ever get my HIV cured with his herbal products. I have tried almost everything but I couldn‚Äôt find any solution for the virus, despite all these happening to me, I always spend a lot of money to buy HIV drugs and other supplements to keep me healthy and taking several medications. Until one day I was just surfing through YouTube  when I came across a great post from Anita, who said that she was diagnosed with HIV and was healed through the help of this great herbal supplements of Dr Harvey, Sometimes I really wonder why people call him the  great Dr.Harvey, I never knew it was all because of the great and perfect work that he has been doing. So I quickly contacted him and told him everything happening to me, and he asked me a few questions and he said something I will never forget, that anyone who contacts him is always getting his/her cure within a few weeks after doing all he asks them to do. So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I'm HIV Negative wow. I'm very amazed and happy about this cure i have really gone through so much pain and tears for this Dr.Harvey cured me with the help of his natural herbs.If you have Anybody going through this same Situation or any kind of cancers or Diseases at all contact Dr Harvey today he cures them all save a life today.You can contact Dr.Harvey EMAIl::[Drharveyphytotherapy@yahoo.com]

"Isaiah 53:5, But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised 
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
 his stripes, we are healed.¬†
For salvation, people just need to 
follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and 
of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and 
resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the 
same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = 
being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's 
what Acts 2:38 is.¬†
We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, 
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that 
OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not 
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. 
St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he 
cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.¬†
We can't come up with our own 
gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven¬†preach 
any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
 him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, 
Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match-up with the 
scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.¬†
Eternity
 is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in 
them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of 
me.¬†
The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The 
book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter 
the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to
 show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.¬†
It's
 better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong 
direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts
 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. 
Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and 
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Jesus 
Christ was our perfect example back to God. He was baptized and received
 the Holy Ghost and we must be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. He 
was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in 
righteousness. He died and rose again, and we must die to the things of 
this world and rise to walk in the newness of life. He prayed to the 
father showing us how to pray to the father. If you believe in this 
message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you!"
"My father was just diagnosed and not operable, we are hoping after four rounds the tumor will shrink so he can have surgery. We are hopeful,  and thousands are praying.  Thank you for this video. We are also with Abramson cancer center.  Amazing how he is being treated.  Beautiful."

My ex died from this at 33 years old. He was a truley beautiful soul. Unfortunately he passed 6 months from diagnosis and it was a horrible ride. I sometimes wish he had seen another doctor who had seen him as an individual
What stage did you have when diagnosed?
my grandma has pancreatic cancer
Some assholes really disliked. Smh
So inspirational üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
OMG...when you said October 2010 my heart rate doubled.....I first had Acute same time!üòí
I'm having symptoms of jaundice I have lack of appetite when I eat I get full fast or I don't want to eat at all my stomach started hurting me and whenever I eat I feel like to throw up
My pancreas is swelling out from under my rib cage . I have several other symtoms and swollen lymph glands. I'm itching all over running low fevers . And no Dr will see me because I'm broke unemployed and have no insurance . They can cure it . But it's all about $ . I went to several Doctors back when I had $ and they blew off my symtoms and told me I'd be fine . I'm pretty sure I'm a dead man at this point
My grandfather died of pancreatic cancer he passed away on may 2 2017
"My daddy fought, my grandpa fought, and surely I will fight whenever hereditary cancer kicks my ass. They didn‚Äòt make it, I will probably not make it, but sooner or later this fucking disease will be treatable. 

Fuck you Cancer!"
"I know a guy that had stage 4 pancreatic cancer.....he got the Rick Simpson cannabis oil recipe and cured his pancreatic cancer....!!!
Cheers...!!!
I find it absurd that a God given plant to humanity is mostly illegal throughout this entire world.
There is are many suppressed technologies that this world has lost 100 of progress."
"My grandpa died, Sunday. January 19,2020. At 66 years old"
"Your lucky miss, my grandma died from this October 2019"
Wow; You Are So Blessed
I‚Äôm sorry but could this be a marketing scheme?
Is this advert for hospital selling treatment for cancer ?  It‚Äôs like selling toothpaste...
"My mother had a surgery, but she didn't make it. :("

Beautiful courageous woman
