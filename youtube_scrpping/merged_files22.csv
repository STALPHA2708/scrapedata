"comment: my name is diane and i am a  year breast cancer survivor my story began november  when i felt a slight burning sensation in my right breast i was working as a daycare provider and neglected to do anything hoping the burning sensation was temporary
on new years eve  the pain was so severe that i scheduled a mammogram the first week of  a few days after i received a letter telling me to return for a second test
a few more days passed and i received a letter telling me that there were suspicious findings on my film that needed further testing my previous mammogram had been in october  what could possibly be wrong
i had nowhere to turn i did not know what to do because the place that did the mammogram only told me to ask my primary care doctor at that time i did not have a primary doctor
i called my older sister and she told me to go to a gynecologist i explained the situation to the gynecologist and immediately she found a doctor to give me a biopsy which i did and it was all to no avail until i met a old time high school mate friend dana who is a survivor who introduced me to a pythothrapist dr harvey to god alone i give all the glory and im forever greatful to dr harvey for being a hand of god in my lifehe cured me with his natural herbs and roots today im a living testimony do not die in silence contact dr harvey today via

"comment: i discovered i had breast cancer by accident i had just given birth to my nd child when i noticed a small lump on my breast milk was coming out but i didnt think anything of it because i was breast feeding well while carrying the baby i noticed a lump and some pain i immediately went to the radiologist where she told me straight out that she believed i should see a doctor asap because i might have breast cancer i was so glad she told me so directly otherwise i probably would have overlooked the milky discharge from my nipple as milk i went through chemotherapy double mastectomy and reconstruction still after some few years the symptoms still persists
it was a long journey and at times i wanted to give up but i kept the fight for my two kids that i have to raise and kept searching for help until a friend of mine who was a survivor of stage  breast cancer introduced me to dr harvey who cured her using his natural herbal remedy
i contacted him by email he got back to me and told me about the solution to my illness and how to go about it i did as he instructed and about the three days i got the cure which he prepared and sent to me through dhl courier service i administered the herbal medicine as he instructed me and thats how i was cured of breast cancer all thanks to the superb healing herbs of dr harvey

i was so ill i could barely walk  meters i hadnt realized how little i appreciated my health until it was taken away from me fortunately i had a fantastic support system even though i was struggling to cope at work i didnt lose my job on the contrary the company i work for my colleagues and my boss have been incredibly supportive throughout my illness
it was a frustrating time because i so desperately wanted to function like a normal human being yet i honestly thought i was going to die i thought i was too far gone it‚Äôs almost as if your body begins to reject everything it requires to sustain life it was probably the scariest time of my life i wished not for a bigger house or more money or a fancy car ‚Äì i wanted to have the strength to go for a simple walk on the beach
to this day that time has stuck with me and it has been lifechanging i wasnt really materialistic before but if i ever find myself becoming caught up in the whirlwind of life i stop and take myself back to that time the best things in life really are priceless all my pains and sorrows turn to joy and history from the day i came in contact with dr harveywho really helped me with his herbal prescriptionsi was told he is a herbals  specialist and he can be of help i gave him a try and it really work out for me today here i am negative contact him via drharveyphytotherapyyahoocom     you can also visit his website for more information and consultation http drharveyherbalworldblogspotcom

comment: it was so shocking to have my mom diagnosed of lung cancer and some researches said it is caused by smoking and she has never smoked all her life this gave us so much concerns and the most saddest part of it was that there is no known cure for it there was really no notable symptoms at the beginning not until she began to cough which got worse everyday and soon enough she was finding it more difficult to talk or breath properly we tried several treatment for a better condition but all proved abortive all the doctors said cancer couldnt be cured but will have to go through a chemo or surgery but this was very risky for us we searched other solution until we heard about a particular traditional doctor called dr balabash who cures cancer with natural herbal remedies completely we contacted doctor with his email drbalabashherbalhomegmailcom and we were given instructions on how to get the herbs which we got after few days through the courier delivery company she was told to take the remedy for one month but just within a few weeks of using it she experienced a total balance in her health all the symptoms like coughing breathing and sleeping problems and other emotional troubles was all gone we went for a checkup after an appointment the sixth week and our doctor was surprised and said the tumor in her lungs is no longer there and shes completely free from cancer i dont know how to explain this but i believe its a miracle nature is life im glad it helped my mom win the war against cancer you can also reach him on his whatsapp number

"comment: my story with breast cancer is a unique one my determination and working in accordance with my heart was key i was diagnosed in september  with stage  breast cancer with mets to the femur bone i cried silently day and night because i wondered who will be there for my kids when im gone i lost my husband  years ago and this also affected me a whole lot
 chemo was never an option as i had seen already what it did to my friend days before she gave up alternative and holistic medicine was my option i had heard about the success stories of patient with cancer that got cured through alternative medicine from clinics and medicine in mexico i was able to get hold of a survivor and he told me about an herbalist he went to in hidalgo mexico we contacted via mail over the phone and through skype i showed him all my scans and blood work cause i wasnt having enough to fly over to mexico he prescribed and shipped some herbs for me that he called  apollo oil and tea which i used for a period of  months he also changed my diet and put me on his diet protocols for this period of time and prescribed some other supplements for me too it was during this time my kids found out i had cancer because i had to change my diet  
they were my wings through it all beating cancer is never an easy journey friends and colleagues will never understand the pains and emotional battle you fight in this its been over a year now mri scan is clear no tumors and blood works came back normal i have been  ned mu oncologist was stunned as he put an expiring date on my life and worst i refused chemo i am not saying conventional treatment is not good cause i have also seen some success stories with it too but my advice to whoever is reading this follow your heart because thats the only way your spirit will work in accordance with whatsoever you choose this is the contact information of the herbalist drehimenherbalgmailcom
 i have shared my own part with the world and i am at peace with myself i know this will save someone"

comment: its true make sure you get your tests done yearly theres no shortage of stuff you can get tested but also make sure you check that the test results are actually accurate before you take action not all tests are accurate
comment: only reason i‚Äôm worried for her is because she is playing valor at  wishing her the best fr tho
comment: i‚Äôm not going to speak for kyedae because she‚Äôs a stranger on the internet but some of these comments are weird asf how does telling a story about someone you knew who died of cancer help anyone what‚Äôs she supposed to do with that go ‚Äúcool i didn‚Äôt ask but i hope that‚Äôs not me‚Äù it‚Äôs the weirdest phenomenon that happens whenever someone is diagnosed it‚Äôs really awkward and not helpful lmao same with googling and commenting the statistics etc which btw show a pool from adults where the median age is  and some refrain from treatment shes young healthy has access to good care plus she seems to have a support system and a pretty good attitude she‚Äôll do great

comment: yep everything that kyedae said is true
"comment: cooking denatures protein enzymes and vitamins and oxidizes fats making it harder to digest grass fed ruminant animals are the most nutritious partly because they can convert unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids which is more stable for your cell membranes and they supply protein to build muscle fruit is a good source of carbs because it wants to be eaten so its seeds are spread around honey is good because it‚Äôs created by bees which are an animal vegetables have defense chemicals because they don‚Äôt want to be eaten you want to give your body as much energy and resources as possible which means eating protein saturated fat and carbs until you are full this will ensure everything will work better as you heal 

eat raw grass fed ruminant animalsmilkbuttersuet and try raw fruitfruit juicehoney experiment eat until full listen to your body your body will self regulate 

you‚Äôre probably going to need to try multiple different sources to see what you like the best buy the best quality food you can afford start slow and gradually change what you eat i started cooking my meat a little bit more rare each time until i just went for it i freeze my meat and then thaw it for a couple hours either in the fridge or on the counter as long as the ruminant ate grass and was healthy you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem if eating fruit or honey or raw doesn‚Äôt make you feel good don‚Äôt force it it took a couple years for me to heal enough to eat fruit and honey i eat  meals a day"

the lesson here is that people shouldnt ever mock what another person is going through however stupid or unreasonable it may seem to you you wouldnt react any better if it happened to you as well it means the world if you just comfort those people instead of getting all insensitive and logical per say

but yes i forgive my bf he can be dumdum as well"

"comment: sorry but i have to agree with pilgrim and others regarding macmillan not giving toss 
when my father was diagnosed with neck cancer earlier this year he was given a green folder with a telephone number in it and sent on his way we havent heard from his nurse from that day to this because once she found out he had a son it was like oh well you may want to talk to him me about bringing you to appointments instead of sending an ambulance out for you fuck off macmillan why should i have to run around reorganising and juggling my life whilst dealing with the possibility of losing my father just to save the nhs a few quid i wouldnt give or advise anyone to donate money to macmillan cancer support if it was the last charity on earth because this advert is far from my experience and in my case they actually let me hit the floor"

comment: have a dear friend with small cell lung cancer been told its aggressive and could spread to other parts of her body thought there would have been a cure out now but all they can do is slow it down with chemo and radiology what happens with all the money donated to charity if we still havent found a cure for this terrible illness yet and why is it some drugs you can only get privately she is heart broken that she is going to die slowly and her life has turned out like this so sad for her
comment: asked if there was anything they could do the reply was there is a new drug on the market wont cure you but it will give you approx  months down side is youll have to go private and it cost approx ¬£ that drug was probably researched and made from charity money all medication for cancer you be freely available on the nhs
comment: i find it amazing we are still no closer to a cure for this terrible illness after all the money that has been poured into different charity organisations even more amazing was the fact the an ex royal marine was on the cancer ward the same time as myself and was told theyd made a mistake and found he had lung cancer

comment: i felt just like that when i received my diagnosis but i was fortunate that i had my partner to explain what the consultant had said ever since hes been my rock and i cant imagine what it would have been like had he not been a part of my life i know what its like to live alone  i did for three years but he was there when my friends drifted out of my life macmillan do an incredible job of being there even answering my silly questions no one needs to be alone with that fear

comment: everyone should feel like that but so few of us do  i have lived with metastatic breast cancer for over  years and i feel so alone most of the time
comment: this  made me cry watching it the ad is a brilliant representation in story and visuals that for me truly captures the emotions and confusion that can happen when receiving such a diagnosis and its subsequent impacts on both the patient and those around them well done macmillan and a massive thank you  for the wonderful work you do and continue to do for us allx

comment: get well soon
"comment: please ead will ne fine
my father was a strong man and after he had surgery for colonrectal cancer he died after a lot of suffering in about three months 
the doctor thought i had the same cancer and wanted to operate on me as i had already studied a lot about cancer i refused the operation the doctor told me that i will be back in six months but  years of a very active life have passed 
if you want to beat the cancer
 chemotherapy means that you destroy not only your cancer cells but also many healthy cells which you need a very bad thing is that it  may destroy your immune system the one that tells the body when you have cancer and that knows how to fight cancer 
 radiotherapy is well known to cause cancer the underlying idea is that cancer cells will die its true it destroys them but it can also turn healthy cells into new cancer cells there is some hope if you follow radiation therapy with doses of radiation very precise targeted at the cancer 
 surgery is a solution but it often spreads the cancer to other parts and thus creates new cancers 

what can you do 
 prayer to god yes god really exists and he asks us to love him people and do good deeds 
 to search very persistently for our sins and mistakes dont look for excuses they only have value if god considers that you deserve to be forgiven don‚Äôt hide yourself behind exchuses like ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt anything to do‚Äù or ‚Äúothers did too‚Äù i searched for my sins and mistakes for several months 
 stop eating meat and sweets it is easier that you think
 daily up to half a liter of beetroot juice 
 seeds of all kinds 
 cancer is not a tragedy fight calmly moderate action 
 it would be very good if you have the strength to follow the treatment of rudolf breuss sure you can
help her please god to be healthy"

comment: it‚Äôs so wonderful that you have an opportunity to ask for a private room to do your chemo i have stage  blood cancer and my immune system is totally depleted with  neutrophils and granulocytes and other very low leukocytes because of chemo treatments yet when i go for chemo infusions at a texas oncology clinic i am the only one who wears a mask and i am not only expected to sit in the general waiting room crammed full of people who don‚Äôt wear masks then crammed in a smaller infusion room sitting elbow to elbow with people getting fluids and iron infusions and i‚Äôm the only one wearing a mask including the oncology nurses and  all of the rest of the staff it‚Äôs totally mind boggling to me because the only time i feel unprotected and unsafe is when i go to my oncology clinic for cancer treatments

comment: a quick note on the yuck taste of the saline flush here in australia we don‚Äôt use the predrawn up syringes of saline i often see in american and canadian videos so we draw up saline from ampoules and it seems the plastic doesn‚Äôt leech into the saline as much because i‚Äôve asked heaps of my patients about it and only  said they had a strange taste from it and it was very subtle so my theory is that the predrawn saline absorbs a little bit of stuff from the syringe plastic and gives that adult taste

comment: i have had a port since i was  not for cancer i have immunodeficiency and other health issues so i get infusions at least once every three weeks for my immunodeficiency since i was  and i got a port when i was  because i was constantly needing picc lines and ivs and they were ruining my veins but i‚Äôve also had many iron transfusions and other things that i use it for and for me personally my experience with it has been good i prefer it to ivs and picc lines all the time it‚Äôs much easier for me and makes things much easier it also allows it to be left in overnight like for example i do infusions at home so we have a nurse come to me and there are times when i have surgery the next day and she is able to leave my port accessed whereas with an iv you can‚Äôt leave it accessed at home and stuff but you can with a port and also something that i recommend idk if you do this already or not but is numbing cream you put it on around  minutes before it‚Äôs accessed and it numbs it so you can‚Äôt feel the prick also i agree the alcohol stuff stinks right through the mask
"comment: reverse your cancer disease today via a very natural herbal process


 i was only  when i was diagnosed with stage  lung cancer i was experiencing shortness of breath and it felt like something was in my throat whenever i raised my hands over my head it would cut off my air supply i went to my primary care doctor who sent me for a ct scan


 my family and i were shocked at the news of my diagnosis with terminal stage  lung cancer my husband and i decided it was best to tell our daughters the truth from the start they were young just  and  and they were worried about me and asked many questions having a plan in place to help me beat cancer made it easier to have that conversation with them


 because the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes i wasn‚Äôt a candidate for surgery my best option was a clinical trial and i was scheduled to receive four rounds of intense chemotherapy with the trial drug after those four heavy rounds i was switched to a lighter maintenance chemotherapy drug and the trial drug for the remainder of my twoyear course of treatment


 during treatment there was so much i worried about i didn‚Äôt want to lose my hair and i endured side effects including nausea and exhaustion

 although after some time the side effects had worsened there was the loss of hair and i had been very exhausted most of the time i also experienced loss of appetite


 it was during my endless research for a permanent remedy on the internet for my condition i was opportune to come across the professional herbal works of dr harry obiego  the african man doctor who had completely reversed the disease via a naturopathic method i had seen testimonials attributed to the service of this herbal doctor and his distinguished skills in the world of phytotherapy i was informed that he was capable of healing cancer via a completely natural herbal procedure and of which i had been really tempted to give his service a trial i had nothing to lose all i had wanted was to be saved from this debilitating disease and in spite of anything it would cost me and providence had thus led this herbal practitioner into my life to give my health life a different interpretation  in brief after having tried his natural medication i had soon started experiencing positive impact in my health life it was too good to be true for after some time of usage i knew i was on the verge of an absolute recovery after some few weeks of using this natural medication i had gone for another biopsy test which had confirmed i had been completely freed from the disease


 this miraculous change in my health life had occurred few months ago and i am very much as pleased to share this piece of information every moment because it means so much to me as to be healthy again and i know inwardly that it would also mean so much to other people who happen to be suffering from this disease and would also prefer a normal life too i wish to use this message to give confidence to those who would by chance happen to come across this information to be hopeful and find a confidant like dr harry obiego in overcoming their health problems you can reach this herbal practitioner today for a healthier tomorrow i would also encourage this piece of information to be shared among friends and loved ones in order to create a positive awareness

"comment: please dont take it it does nothing but destroy ur body inside the chances to get better from it are 
you can treat cancer in  to  months by just eating cruciferous vegetables must be all organic you can make juices out of them too also garlicno green inside lemon and lemon skin and onions are good and water must be spring water 
also take graviola capsules  a day and if you can get to something called pao pereira do that also start releasing fasting is a must you need to fast so that your body eats the bad stuff inside and after that start checking your food habits eliminate non organic foodsalcohol etc from ur life these are not meant for our bodies to consume just like how ducks are not allowed to eat bread yet they do eat it but guess what happens to these ducks they get sick and die its not for them same thing with us we humans too have specific food we can eat and others we cant eat 
do your research trust in what people are saying not some doctor that benefits from your money its a buisness for them be careful i promise you if you follow what i just wrote you will be cured in  to  months do more research on what i said and see for yourself think about it well my friends around me all followed this diet there are many doctors like a herbalist doctor for example that tells you this and even have great knowledge on what herb can  cure you depending on what type of problem u have so alternative cancer treatments i wish you all the best really i hope we all realise that our nowadays lifestyles are unfortunately wrong and that unfortunately some certain ppl actually benefit from all that"

"comment: cancer cells are the result of the aging of our cells¬† this means that cells age regardless of my age¬† there are two causes of accelerated aging of cells¬† first dna methylation and second telomere damage¬† a lobster whose telomeres are not extremely damaged does not get cancer lives an average of  years and an elephant produces  milligrams  grams of vitamin c per day in its body and it has plenty of p genes so it does not get cancer

¬†why does dna methylation occur
¬† stress
¬† smoking and drinking alcohol
¬† virus infection and vaccines vaccination  including covid vaccines
¬† inflammation in the body due to bacterial infection
¬† meat intake saturated fat bad cholesterol
¬† body fat less muscles and sedentary lifestyle
¬† not enough vitamin d in the body¬† vitamin c deficiency
¬† lack of sleep less melatonin
¬† parental genetic issues activity of the p gene

¬†telomere damage is also caused by drinking and smoking heavy metals pesticides burned food fine dust pollutants meat etc

¬†a substance that prevents dna metallization¬†  tofu isoflavin¬† resveratrol¬† folic acid¬† vitamin b¬† curcumin¬† omega  lipozomal vitamin c vitamin d quercetin¬† egcg

¬†you can take up to mg ivermectin a day   days straightly¬† cancer patients in korea took experiments¬† he took mg a day for  days straightly to cure the terminal cancer 

you can not cure cancer with chemo theraphy it does not cure but makes powerful duplication slowlybut eventually die due to cancer


in korea  years old man who has the stage  lung cancer  he had taken tagrisso and radiation theraphy for  years but cancer cells has transfered to spine bones and it grows bigger and bigger so he can not walk and then he stopped taking tagrisso for a while and then he take mg albendazole or penbendazole mebendazole a day with¬† ml olive oil phytocapinoids mg meriva curcumin mg egcg mg metphormin mg omega oilmg trans resveratrol  mg naltrexon vitamin d iu everyday but i think mg benzimidazole is enough with mg cimetidine and ml olive oilthere are no cancer cells in back bone and he can walk  hours and play ping pong the cancer cells in lung is smaller a half now he has taken these for months he have checked liver and blood cells in every  weeksand from now on he takes mg albendazole mg cimetidine ml olive oil phytocanapinoids mg egcg mg meriva curcumin mg metphormin mg naltrexon iu vitamin d mg olive oil everyday  he plays ping pong for  hour everyday"

"comment: vegetarian and seafood food helps a lot in overcoming cancer i heard from a doctor saying that the only thing that defeats cancer fruits and vegetables channel that fights cancer vegan and seafood sakura   the goal of this channel is not to leave the doctor and your treatment the goal is for the doctor to tell you that you do not need an immune test and the tumor has become smaller after the doctor‚Äôs examination of you


 there are carbohydrates in the food i cannot leave you carbohydrates and the food is delicious and i mix with you a lot of vegetables and fruits this food is suitable for many categories of vegetarians and dieters and also cancer patients but caution must be balanced this is a vegetarian system so watch  videos about balancing this system in order not to drop hemoglobin get osteoporosis and break blood

vegan ice cream legumes and nuts and a food balance for vegetarians
httpsyoutubezbbuelhtu 

food balance for vegetarians no dairy suitable for those without anemia
httpsyoutubewcaeddzpoq 

amarnath milk saves vegans the idea is there  you just conveyed the idea 
httpsyoutubehqtiqytre 

do outwork  for  minutes  days a week but you must eat well
listen to the original gospel 
listen to classic songs rap or pop that make you strong"

"comment: this is for both of you a question i know you are in the middle of the battle of your life so if this isn‚Äôt something you want to answer or have thought about or can handle right now just scroll on past this
you two have an identical twin each neither of your twins have experienced cancer as well you are a couple and both have had it within years of each other 
so my question i can‚Äôt help but wonder if this must‚Äôve been environmentally induced some chemical you both consumed in some way lawn maintenance materials like weed killer something you both used while building the house something in your pipes from a home you both lived in etc
i imagine you have many many thoughts and ponder possibilities but maybe not
i just think you are unique in that you have another set of your dna walking around without getting caught cancer which helps to rule out your body just mutating dna 
anyway thanks for hearing me out"

"comment: cancer cells are the result of the aging of our cells¬† this means that cells age regardless of my age¬† there are two causes of accelerated aging of cells¬† first dna methylation and second telomere damage¬† a lobster whose telomeres are not extremely damaged does not get cancer lives an average of  years and an elephant produces  milligrams  grams of vitamin c per day in its body and it has plenty of p genes so it does not get cancer

¬†why does dna methylation occur
¬† stress
¬† smoking and drinking alcohol
¬† virus infection and vaccines vaccination  including covid vaccines

comment: dear delia i stumbled upon this video ironic i went through this a couple of yrs ago i see you getting the red devil infusion  there is a magic mouth wash they can make up for you to help with the mouth sores and sore throat  a really amazing tip for fingernails during chemo  if you have a nail that breaks low close to end of your finger i used water proof tape to cover the tear i cut it round like the finger tip then carefully used emery board to make it fit the nail  this kept me from losing any finger nails  my oncologist is still shocked that i didnt lose a single nail stay strong get lots of rest   you got this girl i just passed the  yr ned  watching this brought back so many memories sending you lots of love light and healing energy and to help with the body pain from the nuelasta taking claritin the day before during and after can help make that not so bad they can also prescribe some numbing gel to put on the port prior to treatment to lower the pain in that area i made it though  rounds of chemo i know that you can do it there is so much love coming in for you

comment: settled on ted ü§£ great interview surgery was not an option for me gleason  with metastatic spot on my spine i meet men all the time that get told by their doctors that they dont need a psa test  which is ridiculous my psa was rising  years before my diagnosis but my doctor at the time told me it was fine
comment: thanks ben for sharing your personal experience i‚Äôm most grateful to you
comment: yeah right my general practician had one brief in the late nineties test every year she stopped testing in  for fear of unnecessary biopsies i should have said no she retested in  the result the cancer had already metastasised tx doc your logic got me nowhere conclusion test every year
comment: wish they would of been truthful and explained his what his psa levels were how his erections are afterthe pain he went through etcnot very helpful just a celebrity bringing awareness

comment: after the removal of the prostate does it get sold if the person is famous
comment: i can only hope he opted for removal of the prostate after tests shows he had a very aggressive kind of tumor i would have liked to learn more about the kind of tumor he had and how he went about assessing the risk of keeping his prostrate vs the risk of letting the cancer run wild
comment: i think its really important to educate ourselves on prostate cancer what it does to the body  what to do if you have it and how to prevent it  contact dr oyalo on channel for natural cure on his channel  i got cured with his remedy
comment: i had fecal cancer but i had a stoolectomy and feel much better i keep having recurrences though
comment: i tested just slightly high on psa x im  after  biopies and an mri i tested positive for prostate cancer i am considering the cyber knife treatment which has the same positive results but with less downtime and recovery  its very important that men get the psa test after their lower to mid s radiation cyber knife and surgery are all good and similar in their success rates it just matters what you prefer  unless of course you are olderyounger and what you prefer or are able to get bravo to ben to speak out
comment: 
comment: good morning ben i just want to thank you for sharing your truthful wisdom and helping other people to realize this is a serious matter when it comes to one out of seven men my name is dennis to pre i have prostate cancer the first time i took the pills about a year ago i didnt have no control over my pee or my poop i can be walking down the streets the pills were so strong i would have the runs so now im going back to ucsf san francisco  parnassus as of tomorrow and getting more treatment because they say if we dont get it treated it will spread to your bones and it can be a much severe consequences and i need to live in the reason i need slaves because i trust in god will help me with

comment: thank u ben
comment: i wouldve never known something wasnt right with my prostate if i didnt decide to go on trt at  years old i dont know why normal blood panels dont include psa when i got my bloodwork from my wellness doctor psa was  which is supposedly normal under got on trt and it jumped up to  came off this is all within a year and psa went back down to went back on trt and psa went back up saw a urologist and he immediately says biopsyi was taken aback thinking it was a very aggressive move so for  months did some research and with a push from the wife i decided to go back and tell him i want the biopsyalthough i dont know why they wouldnt do an mri firstbiopsy is tomorrow better safe than sorryim spreading the word to everyone i come across in healthfitnesslife conversations
comment: i opted for removal too i did educate myself after listening to ben i decided to have mine removed he has lots of money and can afford the best why not
comment: if you keep a check on your psa and it starts going up then the doctor or urologist will probably want to do a biopsy thats what my urologist just done for me he said they would take  core samples he done this biopsy in the hospital and i was completely knocked out when it was over and i came to he told me he took  core samples a week later i went back to his office and he said  of the samples came back positive for cancer but he said my gleason score is  which he said is a low grade cancer he wants to just monitor me closely to see if my psa goes up then if it does he will do another biopsy but i am kinda scared i think i will ask about just having my prostate completely removed i think that would be best but our small town hospital only does the open you up method and not the robotic surgery but there is another hospital  miles away that does the robotic surgery thats another decision i will have to make man life comes at you hard when you get older good luck to anyone reading this if youre in the same boat i am in oh yea my psa is
comment: ben is a wise man  he chose life
comment: we never knew about a psa test my husband was diagnosed on his th birthday with stage  metastatic prostate cancer too late for surgery terrible damage to his nervous system because of the tumors he had zero symptoms and no family history doctors never did this test as the insurance said he was too young for it to be protocol he went through chemo radiation hormone therapy and life is very very painful for him now there needs to be better representation of prostate cancer and to let people know to ask for this psa test that can easily be added to your yearly bloodwork simply by asking pay out of pocket for that test
comment: prostate cancer is not dangerous anymore  you go to operation and remove the prostat you never feel pain in connection to surgery  just take rest after surgery and start running after two month
comment: there is another option and that is the natural way
comment: great interview ben told the truth here  huge respect for him as a man matt asked all the right questions and i still think he‚Äôs one of the best interviewers out there
comment: for men aged  to  years the decision to undergo periodic prostatespecific antigen psabased screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one before deciding whether to be screened men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men however many men will experience potential harms of screening including falsepositive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy overdiagnosis and overtreatment and treatment complications such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction in determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history raceethnicity comorbid medical conditions patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatmentspecific outcomes and other health needs clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening

comment: i‚Äôll never have a psa test it is not a screening test for prostate cancer that‚Äôs a myth  of prostate tumors are benign and in the past no one differentiated between the aggressive and benign tumors  of them this is medical information from the last century i‚Äôm almost  have never had a psa test and never will my body my choice
comment: read the books invasion of the prostate snatchers and the key to prostate cancer by dr scholz who is a prostate oncologist everything you need to know about prostate cancer is in those books dont do like ben did and have his prostate removed which i assume he did because he didnt research it prostate removal is probably the worse choice with radiation being better also needle biopsy is being replaced with t multiparametric mri which is safer than a biopsy  and isnt painful if you go to a urologist who are surgeons guess what hell suggest prostatectomy i had a psa of  and my urologist said i could have it removed or do active surveillance i chose to just keep an eye on it and if it started climbing do something then that was  years ago and im now  years old and have never had to do anything except monitor my psa and have occasional color doppler ultrassound scans my psa had climbed to  a year ago and i started taking  tablespoons of grround flaxseed meal every day and my psa went down to  at my age i dont expect to every have to do anything and will likely die from something other than prostate cancer there is so much to learn about the subject spend some time and read everything you can find especially the books by dr scholz

"comment: does anyone here know of any web sites that have people talking about their cancers and their treatments to cure the cancer naturally or with any methods besides surgery or radiation or outcomes of surgery or radiation i think those sites if there are would be the greatest to read and learn from straight from the horses mouth  

i have prostate cancer which was under active surveillance of gleason  or group   now after a psma pet scan my doctor claims i am now in group  and is going to possibly recommend surgery or radiation when i meet with him next  my psa is within normal for my age of     i want to learn from others that have gone through other methods of treatments for prostate cancer or other cancers and  have been successful to get rid of the cancer

this is a very odd cancer to have and it is so confusing trying to learn on the internet what works and what is truthful

"comment: tomatoes are the fourth most commonly consumed fresh vegetable and the most frequently consumed canned vegetable in the american diet there is emerging epidemiology data supporting the connection between increased tomato consumption and reduced risk for both cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer 
here we will summarize the nutrient and the phytochemical content of tomatoes and tomato products and how these bioactive components might act together to modulate disease development 
recent animal studies have investigated tomatoes lycopene and prostate cancer using the nmethylnnitrosourea and dunning rat models
these animal studies also suggest that diets containing tomatoes may decrease the risk or the progression of prostate cancer due to the frequency and the extent of tomato consumption the supporting epidemiological and animal data which connect increased intakes with decreased cancer and cardiovascular disease risk tomatos role in the american diet is of undeniable importance as part of a healthy diet"

comment: i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in  at the age of   after routine blood work which included psa my primary care doctor said my psa level was high for my age  he referred me to a urologist for a biopsy  urologist was skeptical stating that my psa was within normal range and didnt know why my primary care dr referred me to him but he did perform a biopsy and found that i did indeed have cancer a small speck according to him  after discussing it with the urologist and my doctor i decided not to get immediate treatment but wait and watch  its been six years and i get a psa checked every  months im still within normal range last psa was  i really think my prostate cancer is due to me taking dhea for several years which is a testosterone enhancement i quit taking it in  when i was diagnosed at my doctors urging
"comment: age  diagnosed just this past february started hormone therapy in march because i was told it was the aggressive kind of prostate cancer will be having my prostate removed tomorrow by a robot guided by the doctor of course  will be on hormone therapy for the next  months last year my doctor had me do the psa blood test  the results were elevated but she said she didnt think it was cancer because if it was the levels would be in the s mine was at  she was more concerned with my bpshe was fired in december  i saw a urologist because i had a bladder obstruction which caused me to retain lbs of fluids  also cause my kidneys to start failing had a ct scan  my prostate didnt look abnormal but the doctor scheduled a turp  biopsy at the same time in february he kept me on a catheter for over a month but was not able to pee without selfcatheterizing myself so he did a halfarsed job on the turp i fired him because of that and his inability to give me straight answers and found a much better urologist who examined me and suggested the hormone therapy to lower the testosterone which testosterone helps spread the micro pieces of cancer that cant be detected and to have a robotic laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
dont know how much of the nerves or lymph nodes theyll be able to save but again would you rather have a few inconveniences  possibly extendsave your life or take you chances im  but i dont think thats old and opted to do whatever it takes to extendsave my life over a few inconveniences no family history of prostate cancer my fathers brother got it but he was exposed to agent orange in vietnam  has had other forms of cancer  problems from that too but there is a history of cancer in my family mother died of ovarian cancer  ive had  cousins who survived breast cancer

bottom line guys if youre over  take it seriously  get tested it might just save your life by detecting it  treating it early one of the most survivable types of cancer find a good doctor if the one you find isnt giving you straight answers or giving you the runaround or giving answers you dont like get a second or third or even fourth opinion this isnt something to put off ignore or play around with early detection  treatment will give you the best shot at surviving it i for one plan to be around for a few more decades  hope after tomorrow things will be free  clear of me having cancer"

michael douglas had throat cancer but hes fine nowquit smoking guys and eat healthylower ur psa level"
"comment: i highly recommend reading about the doctor that invented the psa test his name is richard ablin and his book is called the treat prostate hoax 
the test is not cancer specific it stands for prostatespecific antigen a protein produced by the prostate it rises and falls depending on when your tested just because you have a high psa test which is above  according to the medical establishment doesnt mean you have cancer getting biopsy requires the doctor to poke the prostate all over since they have no clue where or if you have it its painful and unnecessary i hear they now have a machine that can check the prostate with ultrasound which is a lot less evasive in any case i would read dr albins book before you decide to do anything"

comment: brave man for sharing that
comment: good on ben for talking about it and raising awareness it‚Äôs a massive dilemma for men deciding if we should get tested my fear is that i get tested then go through years of anxiety possibly treatment with lots of side effects when there is no proof that opting for prostate cancer treatment increases your life expectancy by much it can be in your prostate for years without ever spreading so do i risk going through all this anxiety and treatment giving me a lesser quality of life just so i can live a little longer  i think i‚Äôd rather take my chances and enjoy my life with my prostate intact

"comment: get off drugs  then we might see the weight appear on him 

is there a reason why he should be scared 
if anyone is going to go through this with the doctors show at least be honest with the public 
fame will destroy anybody that thinks they should be a secretive person just because they hide behind the fame  because they want to  make money with their looks 

he looks pretty bad  i would like to see him take a more in depth test for that virus again just to make sure"

"comment: getting a cure for hiv is a powerful concept often spoken of the holy grail of hiv research although effective antihiv drugs have transformed hiv into a chronic manageable condition you live with rather than die from taking lifelong therapy is a very different proposition to being definitively cured i put it to the whole human race that there is an affordable  scalable hiv cure that worked as well as would put the global eradication of new hiv infections within reach while also transforming the lives of those now living with the virus given the effectiveness of this drugs in both treating and preventing hiv infection i will say to everyone reading this  that im a living witness to it unlike fraudsters and online scammers who will play you and leave you frustrated with lose of money and hope this drugs cost less and it is worth a try if you are interested in getting cured of your hiv and all kinds of cancer and other deadly diseases below is the communication link of the doctor who has the new medicine which i took that got me cured totally doctor harvey

comment: chemo is not the only option chemotherapy radiation and other invasive drugs are acceptable medical procedures if they work however the issue is that they only occasionally work todays cancer patients are unaware that alternative cancer treatments based on the body and actual science exist and have the potential to significantly reduce or even completely eradicate harmful cancer cells

"comment: what is rso 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     rso stands for rick simpson oil which is a full extract cannabis oil meant to be taken orally or applied topically rso is a marijuana extract made utilizing a solvent to extract cannabinoids the best solvent used for extraction is everclear solvent this is because it is highly edible some producers uses naphtha solvent for extraction which is highly dangerous for human consumption because it contains a very toxic gas that can help to kill you rather than helping you that is why you see some patients consume rso and complain of numerous side effects whereas proper made rso does not give any side effects

what is the difference between rso and cbd   cbd oil derived from industrial hemp plants only contain cbd while rick simpson oil has a high concentration of thc of at least  and the full range of cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant rso is made using top quality organic indica strains which contains thousands of healing properties whereas cbd is derived  from hemp which contains very limited healing properties rso is capable of healing almost every ailment whereas cbd can only help to provide relief but can not heal

what is the rso  days protocol      rso suggested protocol  the goal of a rso protocol is to consume  grams of rick simpson oil in  days this is a very large
amount of cannabis oil and should be taken with caution increasing the dose gradually to avoid adverse
effects below is a suggested outline for increasing the dose until the recommended  gram per day dose is
achieved

week  start with  doses per day morning midday before bed every  hours
half of a grain of rice per dose

week  double your dose every  days maintaining the x per day schedule

week   gram per day split across  doses until the entire  grams of oil is consumed

week  reduce to a maintenance dose  grams total per month

side effects 
patients starting a rso protocol should plan appropriately as the potential for side effects is greater during the
first three to four weeks of the protocol when consume more than the recommended dose that is why its always advisable to follow the protocol and maintain the right dose recommended once a tolerance is built most patients report few to no negative side
effects the most common side effect is sleepiness and sedation with quality sleep being an important aspect
of the healing process

rso topical use
like rick‚Äôs original success many patients use rso topically for skin cancers to do this place a small
amount of rso on the affected area and cover with a bandage changing the bandage and applying more oil
every  days many patients report that over time the cancerous spots will dry crack and diminish after the
area has healed it‚Äôs recommended to continue applying rso for at least two weeks

how does rso taste 
high quality  rso got a pleasant taste and smell that is the reason why most patient find it preferable to ingest the oil as to get a more better and  faster result

how long does rso take to work  
the effects of the oil similar to most forms of cannabis ingested orally may take up to an hour to feel the effects rick goes on to say the max dose you should consume is a full gram and you should stick with this dose for the remainder of the  weeks

is rso decarboxylated   
also known as full extract cannabis oil because it provides patients with fullspectrum benefits in oil form rso is fully decarboxylated the decarboxylation ensures that thca will become activated or psychoactive

is rso stronger than distillate 
rso is thought to be a more ‚Äúraw‚Äù form of concentrate as it retains more plant matter than distillate which strips away some of it during the extraction process its also an easier diy method that results in a highly potent final product

what are the principal benefits of rso   the principle benefits of using rso have been publicized in relation to cancer treatments but span into other categories as well as a concoction high in thc rso has been said to have benefits that include treating arthritis insomnia depression high blood pressure and a variety of other major diseases

prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone jesus 
christ was our perfect example back to god he was baptized and received
 the holy ghost and we must be baptized and receive the holy ghost he 
was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in 
righteousness he died and rose again and we must die to the things of 
this world and rise to walk in the newness of life he prayed to the
