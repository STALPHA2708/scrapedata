on new years eve  the pain was so severe that i scheduled a mammogram the first week of  a few days after i received a letter telling me to return for a second test
a few more days passed and i received a letter telling me that there were suspicious findings on my film that needed further testing my previous mammogram had been in october  what could possibly be wrong
i had nowhere to turn i did not know what to do because the place that did the mammogram only told me to ask my primary care doctor at that time i did not have a primary doctor
i called my older sister and she told me to go to a gynecologist i explained the situation to the gynecologist and immediately she found a doctor to give me a biopsy which i did and it was all to no avail until i met a old time high school mate friend dana who is a survivor who introduced me to a pythothrapist dr harvey to god alone i give all the glory and im forever greatful to dr harvey for being a hand of god in my lifehe cured me with his natural herbs and roots today im a living testimony do not die in silence contact dr harvey today via

"comment: i discovered i had breast cancer by accident i had just given birth to my nd child when i noticed a small lump on my breast milk was coming out but i didnt think anything of it because i was breast feeding well while carrying the baby i noticed a lump and some pain i immediately went to the radiologist where she told me straight out that she believed i should see a doctor asap because i might have breast cancer i was so glad she told me so directly otherwise i probably would have overlooked the milky discharge from my nipple as milk i went through chemotherapy double mastectomy and reconstruction still after some few years the symptoms still persists
it was a long journey and at times i wanted to give up but i kept the fight for my two kids that i have to raise and kept searching for help until a friend of mine who was a survivor of stage  breast cancer introduced me to dr harvey who cured her using his natural herbal remedy
i contacted him by email he got back to me and told me about the solution to my illness and how to go about it i did as he instructed and about the three days i got the cure which he prepared and sent to me through dhl courier service i administered the herbal medicine as he instructed me and thats how i was cured of breast cancer all thanks to the superb healing herbs of dr harvey

"comment: finding out i was hiv positive wasnt easy but as time has passed i have slowly come to terms with my hivpositive status and try to tackle it with a positive attitude in mid  i became quite ill i developed persistent flulike symptoms headaches a nagging cough and sores that wouldnt heal my skin felt as if it was crawling my legs ached i felt nauseous and lost weight then exhaustion hit it was an indescribable tiredness and no matter how much i slept i never felt rested in   i was hospitalized when my cd count nosedived to  hivnegative people have a cd count of between  and  a cd count of below  is considered dangerously low it was a terrible time i have a vivid memory of sitting in a wheelchair covered with a blanket and catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror i looked and felt like a little old lady
i was so ill i could barely walk  meters i hadnt realized how little i appreciated my health until it was taken away from me fortunately i had a fantastic support system even though i was struggling to cope at work i didnt lose my job on the contrary the company i work for my colleagues and my boss have been incredibly supportive throughout my illness
it was a frustrating time because i so desperately wanted to function like a normal human being yet i honestly thought i was going to die i thought i was too far gone it‚Äôs almost as if your body begins to reject everything it requires to sustain life it was probably the scariest time of my life i wished not for a bigger house or more money or a fancy car ‚Äì i wanted to have the strength to go for a simple walk on the beach
to this day that time has stuck with me and it has been lifechanging i wasnt really materialistic before but if i ever find myself becoming caught up in the whirlwind of life i stop and take myself back to that time the best things in life really are priceless all my pains and sorrows turn to joy and history from the day i came in contact with dr harveywho really helped me with his herbal prescriptionsi was told he is a herbals  specialist and he can be of help i gave him a try and it really work out for me today here i am negative contact him via drharveyphytotherapyyahoocom     you can also visit his website for more information and consultation http drharveyherbalworldblogspotcom

"comment: my story with breast cancer is a unique one my determination and working in accordance with my heart was key i was diagnosed in september  with stage  breast cancer with mets to the femur bone i cried silently day and night because i wondered who will be there for my kids when im gone i lost my husband  years ago and this also affected me a whole lot
 chemo was never an option as i had seen already what it did to my friend days before she gave up alternative and holistic medicine was my option i had heard about the success stories of patient with cancer that got cured through alternative medicine from clinics and medicine in mexico i was able to get hold of a survivor and he told me about an herbalist he went to in hidalgo mexico we contacted via mail over the phone and through skype i showed him all my scans and blood work cause i wasnt having enough to fly over to mexico he prescribed and shipped some herbs for me that he called  apollo oil and tea which i used for a period of  months he also changed my diet and put me on his diet protocols for this period of time and prescribed some other supplements for me too it was during this time my kids found out i had cancer because i had to change my diet  
they were my wings through it all beating cancer is never an easy journey friends and colleagues will never understand the pains and emotional battle you fight in this its been over a year now mri scan is clear no tumors and blood works came back normal i have been  ned mu oncologist was stunned as he put an expiring date on my life and worst i refused chemo i am not saying conventional treatment is not good cause i have also seen some success stories with it too but my advice to whoever is reading this follow your heart because thats the only way your spirit will work in accordance with whatsoever you choose this is the contact information of the herbalist drehimenherbalgmailcom

"comment: please ead will ne fine
my father was a strong man and after he had surgery for colonrectal cancer he died after a lot of suffering in about three months 
the doctor thought i had the same cancer and wanted to operate on me as i had already studied a lot about cancer i refused the operation the doctor told me that i will be back in six months but  years of a very active life have passed 
if you want to beat the cancer
 chemotherapy means that you destroy not only your cancer cells but also many healthy cells which you need a very bad thing is that it  may destroy your immune system the one that tells the body when you have cancer and that knows how to fight cancer 
 radiotherapy is well known to cause cancer the underlying idea is that cancer cells will die its true it destroys them but it can also turn healthy cells into new cancer cells there is some hope if you follow radiation therapy with doses of radiation very precise targeted at the cancer 
 surgery is a solution but it often spreads the cancer to other parts and thus creates new cancers 

what can you do 
 prayer to god yes god really exists and he asks us to love him people and do good deeds 
 to search very persistently for our sins and mistakes dont look for excuses they only have value if god considers that you deserve to be forgiven don‚Äôt hide yourself behind exchuses like ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt anything to do‚Äù or ‚Äúothers did too‚Äù i searched for my sins and mistakes for several months 
 stop eating meat and sweets it is easier that you think
 daily up to half a liter of beetroot juice 
 seeds of all kinds 
 cancer is not a tragedy fight calmly moderate action 
 it would be very good if you have the strength to follow the treatment of rudolf breuss sure you can

"comment: my wife didnt  have cancer but she had a port that i became an expert at  with feeding  her and cleaning  the port 
she had a botched  gallbladder  surgery and it took  years  until she passed  
i miss her more today  then i did when she passed 
your video  popped  up on my feed and you look just like her and it all came back to me
the months in the hospitals  the times  taking care of her feeding  her through  her port
i pray for you  and your husband 
my wife passed  years ago but she is the only woman that i will ever  love 
the hospital visits  at the time were kind of hard but i would gladly spend any hospital  visit  no matter how long or boring  just  to be in the presence  of my beautiful  wife

"comment: reverse your cancer disease today via a very natural herbal process


 i was only  when i was diagnosed with stage  lung cancer i was experiencing shortness of breath and it felt like something was in my throat whenever i raised my hands over my head it would cut off my air supply i went to my primary care doctor who sent me for a ct scan


 my family and i were shocked at the news of my diagnosis with terminal stage  lung cancer my husband and i decided it was best to tell our daughters the truth from the start they were young just  and  and they were worried about me and asked many questions having a plan in place to help me beat cancer made it easier to have that conversation with them


 because the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes i wasn‚Äôt a candidate for surgery my best option was a clinical trial and i was scheduled to receive four rounds of intense chemotherapy with the trial drug after those four heavy rounds i was switched to a lighter maintenance chemotherapy drug and the trial drug for the remainder of my twoyear course of treatment


 during treatment there was so much i worried about i didn‚Äôt want to lose my hair and i endured side effects including nausea and exhaustion

 although after some time the side effects had worsened there was the loss of hair and i had been very exhausted most of the time i also experienced loss of appetite


 it was during my endless research for a permanent remedy on the internet for my condition i was opportune to come across the professional herbal works of dr harry obiego  the african man doctor who had completely reversed the disease via a naturopathic method i had seen testimonials attributed to the service of this herbal doctor and his distinguished skills in the world of phytotherapy i was informed that he was capable of healing cancer via a completely natural herbal procedure and of which i had been really tempted to give his service a trial i had nothing to lose all i had wanted was to be saved from this debilitating disease and in spite of anything it would cost me and providence had thus led this herbal practitioner into my life to give my health life a different interpretation  in brief after having tried his natural medication i had soon started experiencing positive impact in my health life it was too good to be true for after some time of usage i knew i was on the verge of an absolute recovery after some few weeks of using this natural medication i had gone for another biopsy test which had confirmed i had been completely freed from the disease


 this miraculous change in my health life had occurred few months ago and i am very much as pleased to share this piece of information every moment because it means so much to me as to be healthy again and i know inwardly that it would also mean so much to other people who happen to be suffering from this disease and would also prefer a normal life too i wish to use this message to give confidence to those who would by chance happen to come across this information to be hopeful and find a confidant like dr harry obiego in overcoming their health problems you can reach this herbal practitioner today for a healthier tomorrow i would also encourage this piece of information to be shared among friends and loved ones in order to create a positive awareness

you can treat cancer in  to  months by just eating cruciferous vegetables must be all organic you can make juices out of them too also garlicno green inside lemon and lemon skin and onions are good and water must be spring water 
also take graviola capsules  a day and if you can get to something called pao pereira do that also start releasing fasting is a must you need to fast so that your body eats the bad stuff inside and after that start checking your food habits eliminate non organic foodsalcohol etc from ur life these are not meant for our bodies to consume just like how ducks are not allowed to eat bread yet they do eat it but guess what happens to these ducks they get sick and die its not for them same thing with us we humans too have specific food we can eat and others we cant eat 
do your research trust in what people are saying not some doctor that benefits from your money its a buisness for them be careful i promise you if you follow what i just wrote you will be cured in  to  months do more research on what i said and see for yourself think about it well my friends around me all followed this diet there are many doctors like a herbalist doctor for example that tells you this and even have great knowledge on what herb can  cure you depending on what type of problem u have so alternative cancer treatments i wish you all the best really i hope we all realise that our nowadays lifestyles are unfortunately wrong and that unfortunately some certain ppl actually benefit from all that","['comment', 'please', 'dont', 'take', 'nothing', 'destroy', 'ur', 'body', 'inside', 'chance', 'get', 'better', 'treat', 'cancer', 'months', 'eat', 'cruciferous', 'vegetables', 'must', 'organic', 'make', 'juices', 'also', 'garlicno', 'green', 'inside', 'lemon', 'lemon', 'skin', 'onions', 'good', 'water', 'must', 'spring', 'water', 'also', 'take', 'graviola', 'capsule', 'day', 'get', 'something', 'call', 'pao', 'pereira', 'also', 'start', 'release', 'fast', 'must', 'need', 'fast', 'body', 'eat', 'bad', 'stuff', 'inside', 'start', 'check', 'food', 'habit', 'eliminate', 'non', 'organic', 'foodsalcohol', 'etc', 'ur', 'life', 'mean', 'body', 'consume', 'like', 'duck', 'allow', 'eat', 'bread', 'yet', 'eat', 'guess', 'happen', 'duck', 'get', 'sick', 'die', 'thing', 'us', 'humans', 'specific', 'food', 'eat', 'others', 'cant', 'eat', 'research', 'trust', 'people', 'say', 'doctor', 'benefit', 'money', 'buisness', 'careful', 'promise', 'follow', 'write', 'cure', 'months', 'research', 'say', 'see', 'think', 'well', 'friends', 'around', 'follow', 'diet', 'many', 'doctor', 'like', 'herbalist', 'doctor', 'example', 'tell', 'even', 'great', 'knowledge', 'herb', 'cure', 'depend', 'type', 'problem', 'u', 'alternative', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'wish', 'best', 'really', 'hope', 'realise', 'nowadays', 'lifestyles', 'unfortunately', 'wrong', 'unfortunately', 'certain', 'ppl', 'actually', 'benefit']"

¬†why does dna methylation occur
¬† stress
¬† smoking and drinking alcohol
¬† virus infection and vaccines vaccination  including covid vaccines
¬† inflammation in the body due to bacterial infection
¬† meat intake saturated fat bad cholesterol
¬† body fat less muscles and sedentary lifestyle
¬† not enough vitamin d in the body¬† vitamin c deficiency
¬† lack of sleep less melatonin
¬† parental genetic issues activity of the p gene

¬†telomere damage is also caused by drinking and smoking heavy metals pesticides burned food fine dust pollutants meat etc

¬†a substance that prevents dna metallization¬†  tofu isoflavin¬† resveratrol¬† folic acid¬† vitamin b¬† curcumin¬† omega  lipozomal vitamin c vitamin d quercetin¬† egcg

 there are carbohydrates in the food i cannot leave you carbohydrates and the food is delicious and i mix with you a lot of vegetables and fruits this food is suitable for many categories of vegetarians and dieters and also cancer patients but caution must be balanced this is a vegetarian system so watch  videos about balancing this system in order not to drop hemoglobin get osteoporosis and break blood

dont know how much of the nerves or lymph nodes theyll be able to save but again would you rather have a few inconveniences  possibly extendsave your life or take you chances im  but i dont think thats old and opted to do whatever it takes to extendsave my life over a few inconveniences no family history of prostate cancer my fathers brother got it but he was exposed to agent orange in vietnam  has had other forms of cancer  problems from that too but there is a history of cancer in my family mother died of ovarian cancer  ive had  cousins who survived breast cancer

bottom line guys if youre over  take it seriously  get tested it might just save your life by detecting it  treating it early one of the most survivable types of cancer find a good doctor if the one you find isnt giving you straight answers or giving you the runaround or giving answers you dont like get a second or third or even fourth opinion this isnt something to put off ignore or play around with early detection  treatment will give you the best shot at surviving it i for one plan to be around for a few more decades  hope after tomorrow things will be free  clear of me having cancer","['comment', 'age', 'diagnose', 'past', 'february', 'start', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'march', 'tell', 'aggressive', 'kind', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'prostate', 'remove', 'tomorrow', 'robot', 'guide', 'doctor', 'course', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'next', 'months', 'last', 'year', 'doctor', 'psa', 'blood', 'test', 'result', 'elevate', 'say', 'didnt', 'think', 'cancer', 'level', 'would', 'mine', 'concern', 'bpshe', 'fire', 'december', 'saw', 'urologist', 'bladder', 'obstruction', 'cause', 'retain', 'lbs', 'fluids', 'also', 'cause', 'kidneys', 'start', 'fail', 'ct', 'scan', 'prostate', 'didnt', 'look', 'abnormal', 'doctor', 'schedule', 'turp', 'biopsy', 'time', 'february', 'keep', 'catheter', 'month', 'able', 'pee', 'without', 'selfcatheterizing', 'halfarsed', 'job', 'turp', 'fire', 'inability', 'give', 'straight', 'answer', 'find', 'much', 'better', 'urologist', 'examine', 'suggest', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'lower', 'testosterone', 'testosterone', 'help', 'spread', 'micro', 'piece', 'cancer', 'cant', 'detect', 'robotic', 'laparoscopic', 'radical', 'prostatectomy', 'dont', 'know', 'much', 'nerve', 'lymph', 'nod', 'theyll', 'able', 'save', 'would', 'rather', 'inconvenience', 'possibly', 'extendsave', 'life', 'take', 'chance', 'im', 'dont', 'think', 'thats', 'old', 'opt', 'whatever', 'take', 'extendsave', 'life', 'inconvenience', 'family', 'history', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'father', 'brother', 'get', 'expose', 'agent', 'orange', 'vietnam', 'form', 'cancer', 'problems', 'history', 'cancer', 'family', 'mother', 'die', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'ive', 'cousins', 'survive', 'breast', 'cancer', 'bottom', 'line', 'guy', 'youre', 'take', 'seriously', 'get', 'test', 'might', 'save', 'life', 'detect', 'treat', 'early', 'one', 'survivable', 'type', 'cancer', 'find', 'good', 'doctor', 'one', 'find', 'isnt', 'give', 'straight', 'answer', 'give', 'runaround', 'give', 'answer', 'dont', 'like', 'get', 'second', 'third', 'even', 'fourth', 'opinion', 'isnt', 'something', 'put', 'ignore', 'play', 'around', 'early', 'detection', 'treatment', 'give', 'best', 'shoot', 'survive', 'one', 'plan', 'around', 'decades', 'hope', 'tomorrow', 'things', 'free', 'clear', 'cancer']"

"comment: i highly recommend reading about the doctor that invented the psa test his name is richard ablin and his book is called the treat prostate hoax 
the test is not cancer specific it stands for prostatespecific antigen a protein produced by the prostate it rises and falls depending on when your tested just because you have a high psa test which is above  according to the medical establishment doesnt mean you have cancer getting biopsy requires the doctor to poke the prostate all over since they have no clue where or if you have it its painful and unnecessary i hear they now have a machine that can check the prostate with ultrasound which is a lot less evasive in any case i would read dr albins book before you decide to do anything","['comment', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'doctor', 'invent', 'psa', 'test', 'name', 'richard', 'ablin', 'book', 'call', 'treat', 'prostate', 'hoax', 'test', 'cancer', 'specific', 'stand', 'prostatespecific', 'antigen', 'protein', 'produce', 'prostate', 'rise', 'fall', 'depend', 'test', 'high', 'psa', 'test', 'accord', 'medical', 'establishment', 'doesnt', 'mean', 'cancer', 'get', 'biopsy', 'require', 'doctor', 'poke', 'prostate', 'since', 'clue', 'painful', 'unnecessary', 'hear', 'machine', 'check', 'prostate', 'ultrasound', 'lot', 'less', 'evasive', 'case', 'would', 'read', 'dr', 'albins', 'book', 'decide', 'anything']"

comment: wouldve  shouldve couldve where did it get you‚Åâ the words many who know who they are will have to live with forever i have a sister  yrs younger than me a musical genius who graduated a yr early from hs  a year early with honors earning two bachelor degrees from berklee college of music in boston shes been an alcoholic for over  years  has lived on the streets of camden nj  nyc yes we offered her help but addicts will choose their path to sobriety if  when they are ready she fortunately did but will never be the same sister i once had  butthe one thing i always did  still do  the one simple yet sometimes  life saving thing an addict like aaron carter will never refuse are phone calls from family just to say i love you how are you‚Åâand now that this talented loving young man is gone hes getting more attention  love that he ever asked for i know nothing about his life but if he didnt at least get this then shame on all of you for the past yrs i watched  enjoyed this talented funny young man who was full of life  had dreams of a successful future i had faith in him as his dedicated fans did also  we encouraged him  gave him the support he so desperately needed  deserved he was obviously an extremely talented young  man who was chewed up  spit out by the industry regardless of his  circumstances we should all be grown enough to have empathy  common sense to understand his young fame  sometimes the repercussions  that can go with it but if you were his family i can only hope you at least picked up that phone to call him send a card  have said those wordsi love you how are you doing  i am deeply heartbroken at his loss he didnt get to know how he had a positive impact on so many peoples lives i myself have had a difficult year  watching aaron live got me through to a better place again he innocently opened his life live to his fans  to the haters who made cruel comments that i would wonder what kind of person raised evil trash like them to say such things to another human being  thank you aaron for sharing your sense of humor  your amazing songs you wrote the birth of your precious son  hearing your excitement of plans you had for your future its very unfortunate you gave so much of yourself to us  never asked anything back in return but for love understanding  acceptance  a chance you worked for most certainly earned you never got to know you saved me  im sure many others as watching you got me through my difficult time  meanwhile our hands are tied to return the favor  you tragically  lose your life yet you saved mine  im sure many others i never got a chance to say thank you young man i still have faith  believe in you    rip aaron carter,"['comment', 'wouldve', 'shouldve', 'couldve', 'get', 'word', 'many', 'know', 'live',

"comment: what is rso 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     rso stands for rick simpson oil which is a full extract cannabis oil meant to be taken orally or applied topically rso is a marijuana extract made utilizing a solvent to extract cannabinoids the best solvent used for extraction is everclear solvent this is because it is highly edible some producers uses naphtha solvent for extraction which is highly dangerous for human consumption because it contains a very toxic gas that can help to kill you rather than helping you that is why you see some patients consume rso and complain of numerous side effects whereas proper made rso does not give any side effects

what is the difference between rso and cbd   cbd oil derived from industrial hemp plants only contain cbd while rick simpson oil has a high concentration of thc of at least  and the full range of cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant rso is made using top quality organic indica strains which contains thousands of healing properties whereas cbd is derived  from hemp which contains very limited healing properties rso is capable of healing almost every ailment whereas cbd can only help to provide relief but can not heal

what is the rso  days protocol      rso suggested protocol  the goal of a rso protocol is to consume  grams of rick simpson oil in  days this is a very large
amount of cannabis oil and should be taken with caution increasing the dose gradually to avoid adverse
effects below is a suggested outline for increasing the dose until the recommended  gram per day dose is
achieved

week  start with  doses per day morning midday before bed every  hours
half of a grain of rice per dose

week  double your dose every  days maintaining the x per day schedule

week   gram per day split across  doses until the entire  grams of oil is consumed

week  reduce to a maintenance dose  grams total per month

side effects 
patients starting a rso protocol should plan appropriately as the potential for side effects is greater during the
first three to four weeks of the protocol when consume more than the recommended dose that is why its always advisable to follow the protocol and maintain the right dose recommended once a tolerance is built most patients report few to no negative side
effects the most common side effect is sleepiness and sedation with quality sleep being an important aspect
of the healing process

rso topical use
like rick‚Äôs original success many patients use rso topically for skin cancers to do this place a small
amount of rso on the affected area and cover with a bandage changing the bandage and applying more oil
every  days many patients report that over time the cancerous spots will dry crack and diminish after the
area has healed it‚Äôs recommended to continue applying rso for at least two weeks

how does rso taste 
high quality  rso got a pleasant taste and smell that is the reason why most patient find it preferable to ingest the oil as to get a more better and  faster result

how long does rso take to work  
the effects of the oil similar to most forms of cannabis ingested orally may take up to an hour to feel the effects rick goes on to say the max dose you should consume is a full gram and you should stick with this dose for the remainder of the  weeks

is rso decarboxylated   
also known as full extract cannabis oil because it provides patients with fullspectrum benefits in oil form rso is fully decarboxylated the decarboxylation ensures that thca will become activated or psychoactive

is rso stronger than distillate 
rso is thought to be a more ‚Äúraw‚Äù form of concentrate as it retains more plant matter than distillate which strips away some of it during the extraction process its also an easier diy method that results in a highly potent final product

what are the principal benefits of rso   the principle benefits of using rso have been publicized in relation to cancer treatments but span into other categories as well as a concoction high in thc rso has been said to have benefits that include treating arthritis insomnia depression high blood pressure and a variety of other major diseases

"comment: isaiah  but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised 
for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with
 his stripes we are healed¬†
for salvation people just need to 
follow the way they did it in acts they were baptized in the water and 
of the spirit heres why the gospel is the death burial and 
resurrection of jesus christ if we are to follow him we must do the 
same thing death repentance burial  baptism and resurrection  
being filled with the holy ghost and rising again from the dead thats 
what acts  is¬†
we must obey the gospel  thessalonians  
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that 
obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ matthew  not 
every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 
st john  except a man be born of water and of the spirit he 
cannot enter into the kingdom of god¬†
we cant come up with our own 
gospel galatians  but though we or an angel from heaven¬†preach 
any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let
 him be accursed dont be cursed one way for all people jews 
gentiles and samaritans our salvation has to matchup with the 
scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away¬†
eternity
 is tooo long to be wrong st john  search the scriptures for in 
them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of 
me¬†
the gospels show what christ has done on the cross for us the 
book of acts shows us the beginning of christs church and how to enter 
the church obeying acts  the letters were written to the church to
 show us how to behave now that we are born again into the church¬†
its
 better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong 
direction are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles acts
  and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrines 
ephesians  we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and 
prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone jesus 
christ was our perfect example back to god he was baptized and received
 the holy ghost and we must be baptized and receive the holy ghost he 
was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in 
righteousness he died and rose again and we must die to the things of 
this world and rise to walk in the newness of life he prayed to the
